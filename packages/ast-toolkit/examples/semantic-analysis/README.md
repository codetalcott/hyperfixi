# Semantic Analysis Example

This example demonstrates advanced semantic analysis capabilities of the AST Toolkit:

- Intent extraction from code structures
- Code similarity detection and comparison
- Semantic pattern recognition
- Code variation generation

## What This Example Shows

1. **Intent Analysis**: Understanding what code is trying to accomplish
2. **Similarity Detection**: Comparing different code structures for semantic similarity
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying recurring semantic patterns
4. **Code Variations**: Generating different approaches to achieve the same goals

## Key Features

- **Multi-Level Analysis**: Structural, behavioral, and conceptual analysis
- **Relationship Mapping**: Understanding how different parts of code interact
- **Complexity Assessment**: Semantic complexity beyond traditional metrics
- **Variation Generation**: Creating alternative implementations

## Usage

```bash
npx tsx example.ts
```

## Example Analysis Types

The example demonstrates:

1. **Intent Extraction** from different types of interactive code
2. **Similarity Analysis** between different implementations
3. **Pattern Recognition** for common interaction patterns
4. **Code Variation** generation with different approaches
5. **Relationship Analysis** between code components

## Learning Outcomes

After running this example, you'll understand:

- How semantic analysis differs from syntactic analysis  
- When similarity detection is useful for code understanding
- How to identify and categorize code patterns automatically
- How to generate meaningful code variations
- How to map relationships between code components

## Real-World Applications

This functionality enables:

- Intelligent code search and recommendation systems
- Automated code review focusing on intent and patterns  
- Educational tools that explain code behavior
- Refactoring suggestions based on semantic similarity
- Documentation generation from code intent analysis
