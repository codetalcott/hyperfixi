/**
 * The render every translation takes: a colliding variable in parentheses,
 * where the plain render would be misread.
 *
 * A translation writes a variable verbatim, so a variable spelled like a
 * structure word of the target language reaches its reader as the word (es
 * `si`, if). The reader tells them apart by where the word stands
 * (`parser/value-reading.ts`), and where that is not enough — de `ist` (is)
 * after an operator, fr `sur` (on) in a condition — the plain render is read
 * as something else. There, and only there, the variable is written `(ist)`,
 * which the reader fuses into one name (`registry.tokenize`). A render the
 * reader already reads right is unchanged: every loop over tr/pl `i` stays
 * `i`. A variable the renderer wrote in the language's own word (a word that
 * alone reads back as the same value) is re-read the same way, and written as
 * spelled where its neighbours change it (vi `đặt` + `giá trị` is `set`; P49).
