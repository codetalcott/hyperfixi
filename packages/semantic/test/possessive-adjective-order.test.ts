/**
 * A possessive ADJECTIVE precedes its property.
 *
 * `put my value into #preview` rendered into six languages with the adjective
 * AFTER the property — ar `قيمة لي`, id `nilai saya`, sw `thamani yangu`,
 * pl `wartość mój` — and that order does not parse back. Measured, on the same
 * command in each language:
 *
 *   sw  weka yangu thamani kwa #out   -> put, patient:property-path
 *   sw  weka thamani yangu kwa #out   -> NULL
 *   pl  umieść mój wartość do #out    -> put, patient:property-path
 *   pl  umieść wartość mój do #out    -> put, patient:EXPRESSION  (mis-typed)
 *
 * ar and id behave like sw: the rendered order returns null outright.
 *
 * THE MISTAKE WAS READING ONE FIELD FOR TWO QUESTIONS. The branch keyed on
 * `possessive.markerPosition === 'after-object'`, but that field says where a
 * MARKER sits relative to the OWNER (qu `noqa-pa`, bn `র`). It says nothing
 * about where an ADJECTIVE sits relative to the PROPERTY, and the two are not
 * the same question — every language that has a possessive adjective puts it
 * first. Marker-based owners still consult `markerPosition`, in the switch
 * further down, which is why this change does not disturb them.
 *
 * This is the other half of the possessive family. #935 fixed SELECTOR owners
 * (`#picker's value` -> `valor de #picker`) and deliberately left reference
 * owners alone, because rewriting them property-first — the wrong fix for this
 * half — cost ms four rows and qu four more. The right fix turns out to be the
 * opposite direction, which is why the two had to be separated.
 *
 * Measured: +70 pairs, zero regressions.
