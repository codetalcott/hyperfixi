>
> - Broad coerce (any non-`on` command event, simple identifier → literal): **mean R1 −0.0022, ALL

>   `update(value:42)` as one expression (a call, never coerced). EN→literal vs translation→
>   expression = fresh 23-lang mismatch.
> - Scope to `trigger` only: **mean R1 −0.0007** (4 SOV gains, 19 drops). The drops are behaviors:
>   EN keeps the NAMESPACED `trigger draggable:start` → `:expression` (the `:` excludes it from the
>   simple-identifier regex), but translations STRIP the namespace to a bare `draggable` (a known

> **Lesson (the load-bearing one):** R1 is recall of EN's role signature, so making the EN

> differently (namespace-stripped, captured-as-call, left-as-identifier). Unlike the URL/event-

> fix is upstream **translation-side** event parsing (preserve the `:namespace` in behavior trigger
> events; split `update(value:42)` into event+detail like EN), which belongs to the behaviors-source
> migration, not an R1 coercion. **Deprioritize `trigger.event`** until those land. (The reusable
> insight: a value-type coercion is only a clean R1 win when EN is the OUTLIER that translations
> already agree against — here EN was the _correct_ one and translations disagreed in many ways.)
>
> **Other findings from this re-grounding (for the next session):** (1) The EN for-each reference
> `repeat for item in .items` produces a PHANTOM `event:literal=in` (the `in` iteration keyword
> mis-captured as an event) AND drops `.items` entirely — same greedy-generated-repeat bug PR #521
> fixed for `times`/`forever`. Removing the phantom is a candidate but measured net-zero (drops the
> `event` miss but the cleanest HEAD-only pattern that consumes `in .items` adds a `source`/
> `destination` miss the translations don't match — the two-sided for-each problem). (2) The
> `repeat.loopType:literal` (123×) residue is a **loop-keyword vocab gap**: the corpus leaves
> `forever`/`times` UNTRANSLATED in most langs (es `repetir forever`, ja `繰り返し forever`) — the
> es i18n dict has `while`/`until` but NOT `forever`/`times`, and `repeat-while` consequently parses
> `loopType:literal=while` correctly while `repeat-forever` degenerates to `loopType:reference=me`.
> Fixing it is two-sided (i18n dict + semantic profile per lang + corpus regen) — the real next big
> lever, but a dedicated multi-file arc.

## The leverage map (what's actually non-faithful) — 2026-06-17

> **Snapshot — superseded by the 2026-06-21 baseline** (degenerate 9, lossy 53; see the

Of the **131** non-faithful instances (29 degenerate + 94 lossy + 8 hard-fail),
two clusters dominate:

| Cluster                                                                         | degenerate | lossy | hard-fail |  total |   share |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: | ----: | --------: | -----: | ------: |
| **Behaviors** (removable/sortable/resizable/draggable + install)                |         18 |    47 |         0 | **65** | **50%** |
| **Reactivity** (bind-\* / live-\* / two-way / computed / intercept / window-\*) |          8 |     0 |         8 | **16** |     12% |
| **Control-flow** (`unless-condition` + then-chain bodies)                       |          1 |    10 |         0 |     11 |      8% |
| Long tail (get-value, tell-\*, set-color-variable, …)                           |          2 |    37 |         0 |     39 |     30% |

Per-pattern: `behavior-removable` 6 degen + 17 lossy (was 13 degen + 8 lossy + 2 hard) ·
`behavior-sortable` 9 degen + 14 lossy · `unless-condition` 1 degen + 8 lossy ·
`behavior-resizable` 1 degen + 8 lossy (was 21 lossy + 2 degen — the block-`if` fix) ·
`behavior-draggable` 8 lossy (was 23 lossy). **Hard fails were all reactivity** (ms `bind-*`×4,
sw `two-way-binding`/`computed-value`/`input-char-count`, tr `window-resize`); **PRs #446 + #447
cleared ms+sw (7 of 8)** — only `tr window-resize` remains (parse rate now **3695/3696**). See
the Track 2 increment notes below.

## Plan — ranked by leverage

### Track 1 (top priority) — Behaviors: curate the showcase, fix the curated bug, harden the _system_

**The goal is not comprehensiveness.** We are not shipping a large behavior library —
the priority is **getting the behavior _system_ right**: a clear path for the user
community and LLM agents to write and install new behaviors, with the curated set as a
showcase of _what a behavior is_ and _what kinds hyperfixi enables_. The product decision
already exists in [`packages/behaviors/src/curation.ts`](../packages/behaviors/src/curation.ts):

- **Curated 5 (the supported story):** Toggleable, **Removable**, ClickOutside, Clipboard,
  AutoDismiss — real `on event → DOM action` inline scripts (the demonstration of "what is a behavior").
- **Optional 3:** FocusTrap, ScrollReveal, Tabs — primitives / nice-to-haves.
- **Experimental 3:** Draggable, Sortable, Resizable — labeled "stateful async components."
  **But each already ships a complete hyperscript `source`** and is the _only_ tier still
  executed via an **imperative JS** `install()` that bypasses that source. So the label is
  provisional: the boundary test is operational, not philosophical (see item 1).

**Constraint (user, 2026-06-16): no behavior may be implemented in imperative JS — all must
compile from hyperscript `source` (single source of truth).** Audit (2026-06-16): only
Draggable/Sortable/Resizable violate this (`imperativeInstaller`); the other 8 are clean.

The fix is to **eliminate imperative JS first**, then align curation, then invest in the system:

> **Status: item 1 DONE (2026-06-16, branch `feat/behaviors-no-imperative-js`).** Draggable /
> Sortable / Resizable now compile from `source`; `imperativeInstaller` under behaviors/ = 0.
> Required: parser CSS-interp whitespace fix (merged #440), `repeat until event … from <target>`
> resolution fix (core `repeat.ts`), and three source-idiom swaps (Resizable `*width`, Sortable
> `target.closest("li")`, `or pointerup` in the inner waits). Three runtime bugs surfaced en route
> — see **Runtime correctness follow-ups** below. Items 2 (`behavior-removable`) and 3 (the system)
> remain.

1. **Resolve the Experimental 3 to hyperscript `source` — fix-vs-cut is per-behavior and
   runtime-driven, not a blanket cut.** Each already has real source; the imperative installer
   exists because the runtime historically couldn't execute the source's advanced features.
   So, per behavior: (a) run its `source` and see what the runtime drops — Draggable needs
   `repeat until event pointerup`, `wait for pointermove or pointerup from document`, `measure
x/y`, and dynamic `add { left: ${…}px }` style templating; (b) if the runtime executes it,
   **delete the imperative `install()` and route through `source`** (same path as the curated 8)
   — this both honors the no-imperative-JS rule _and_ makes the multilingual fidelity follow for
   free (parse of one source); (c) **cut only** the behavior whose source genuinely can't execute
   without a runtime feature too costly to add — and even then, prefer fixing the feature, since
   it's likely shared (`repeat-until-event` is already a tracked gate pattern). Start with
   Draggable (we had it working before; richest source) as the bellwether for Sortable/Resizable.
2. ~~**Fix `behavior-removable` — it is CURATED, so its failures are real bugs.**~~ **DONE**
   (2026-06-17, PR #445). Was the only behavior with **hard** parse failures (he/zh null parse).
   Two stacked bugs, both fixed: (a) the i18n transformer inserted a pre-positioned object marker
   before the behavior name in he/zh (`behavior את Removable` / `behavior 把 Removable`), breaking
   the semantic block parser's `tokens[1]` name detection — fixed by `resolveNameTokenIndex`
   skipping a leading patient-marker token ([`block-parser.ts`](../packages/semantic/src/parser/block-parser.ts));
   (b) `parseConditional` dropped the condition of block-style `if <cond>` (no inline `then`) in
   **all** non-English languages — fixed in [`transformer.ts`](../packages/i18n/src/grammar/transformer.ts).
   he/zh now parse 154/154 (lossy: he 0.556, zh 0.667). The condition fix is cross-language, so it
   rippled: `behavior-removable` degen→lossy in 7 other langs, draggable/resizable ~23 → 8–9
   non-faithful each, avgFidelity + avgRoleFidelity up everywhere, zero regressions. It is still
   6 degen + 17 lossy (the body sub-parse drops `trigger`/`remove`/`halt` after the conditionals) —
   a faithful pass is future headroom, not a regression. Remaining behavior debt is now
   `behavior-sortable` (9 degen + 14 lossy) and the Experimental-3 source execution (item 1).

3. **The actual priority — the authoring + install system for community & LLM agents:**
   - ~~**Authoring guide**~~ **DONE** (2026-06-16): `packages/behaviors/AUTHORING.md` — the
     canonical "what is a behavior / boundary test / how to write one / install + resolver /
     agent checklist" doc, for humans _and_ agents. Stale `core/BEHAVIORS.md` +
     `SORTABLE_BEHAVIOR_GUIDE.md` (old imperative architecture) replaced with redirects.
   - **Install path:** the resolver hook already works (`install X` → `_hyperscript.behaviors.resolve(X)`
     → compile-on-first-use, `packages/behaviors/src/behavior-resolver.ts`) — now documented in
     AUTHORING.md §7 as the public extension point.
   - **LLM-agent path (boundary _validator_) — SKIPPED for now** (decision 2026-06-16: too heavy
     for this stage of adoption). AUTHORING.md §9 already gives agents a boundary checklist; an
     MCP/programmatic validator that _enforces_ it (reject component-shaped behaviors) is deferred
     until adoption justifies the weight. Revisit when there's real third-party behavior authoring.

**Layer:** runtime (execute the Experimental-3 source + the Removable parse bug) + product
curation + DX/tooling (the system). **Owner docs:** `packages/behaviors/AUTHORING.md`,
MULTILINGUAL_BEHAVIORS_PLAN.md, BEHAVIORS_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md. **Audit cmd:** grep
`imperativeInstaller` under `packages/behaviors/src/behaviors/` — must reach 0.

### Track 2 — Reactivity: bring the multilingual parse path up to the runtime

> **htmx v4 syntax verified (2026-06-17, against four.htmx.org).** htmx v4 reactivity is the
> **`hx-live` extension only** — a JS-expression body re-run via a document-wide
> `MutationObserver` + `input`/`change` events + post-swap, with a `q()` selector proxy and
> `debounce`/`timeout`/`trigger`/`take`/`nextFrame` scope helpers — plus the separate `hx-sse`
> / `hx-ws` streaming extensions. **htmx v4 has NO `hx-bind`, `hx-computed`, two-way binding,
> or signals.** So of the gate's reactivity patterns, only **`live`** descends from htmx v4
> (`hx-live` → hyperfixi's `live … end`, with a hyperscript body instead of upstream's JS — a

> (Possible follow-up unrelated to the gate: hyperfixi's SSE/WS compat uses the htmx-2-era
> `sse-connect`/`ws-connect` attribute names; htmx v4 ships these as the `hx-sse`/`hx-ws`
> extensions. Worth reconciling in the htmx-compat layer, but out of scope for the parse path.)

**Decision (settled): reactivity is in scope and must be supported in the multilingual path.**
This is a parser/profile build-out, not an exclusion.

**Remaining: 1 hard fail + hi block cluster — precise diagnoses (deferred, each its own arc):**

1. **tr `window-resize` (the last hard-fail).** Two stacked issues. (a) The sw-style event-name
   gap, but worse: the i18n transformer emits `boyut_değiştir` for `resize`, and the tr tokenizer
   **splits on `_`** → `boyut` / `_` / `değiştir`, where `değiştir` alone normalizes to **`toggle`**
   (collision). So the resize event is destroyed, not just unrecognized. The click form
   (`tıklama`, single token) parses identically, so a single-token resize recognition is the core
   fix — but it needs the underscore-split resolved (cf. the `enyakın` fused-token fix), likely an
   i18n-side single-word resize emission + tr tokenizer entry. (b) Independently, the `debounced
at 200ms` event modifier is left untranslated and fronted by the SOV reorder. Both needed for
   the full gate pattern. 1 hard-fail, ~2 fixes — lower ROI than the hi block cluster.

   > **Data point (2026-06-21, ru/uk install-behavior).** The same underscore-split bit ru/uk
   > `install`: the profile's disambiguator `установить_пакет` / `встановити_пакет` was inert
   > because the ru/uk tokenizer splits on `_` → `установить` → `set` (install ≡ set homonym),
   > so `install-behavior` was degenerate. **Resolved WITHOUT touching the tokenizer** by giving
   > install a distinct single-token loanword (`инсталлировать` / `інсталювати`) in both the
   > semantic profile + i18n dict (degenerate 6 → 4, zero regressions). For tr `window-resize`,
   > the equivalent single-token route would be a non-underscore resize keyword that doesn't
   > collide with `toggle` — likely cleaner than teaching the tr tokenizer to keep `_`-compounds
   > whole. The `debounced at 200ms` modifier is the separate, harder half.

2. **hi `live-derived-value` / `live-multiple-deps` (degenerate); also `intercept` blocks.** The
   genuine **reactive block-shape** work: `live`/`intercept` (and `eventsource`/`socket`/
   `worker`) are `bareKeyword` blocks (`hasBody:true`), but `block-parser.ts` only handles
   `behavior`/`def`. In non-English the `live … end` / `intercept … end` block parses as a bare
   `on`, dropping the block action. Teach the block layer the bareKeyword block shape (mirrors
   the behavior/`def` structural layer).

**Layer:** (1) sw semantic parser/tokenizer · (2) i18n transformer (SOV event reorder + modifier
xlate) · (3) semantic block-parser (bareKeyword blocks). Start with (1) — most leverage, cleanest
scope.

>   (live) keyword, so the block parsed as a bare `on` + `put`, dropping `live`. Fix:

### Track 3 — R1 role-fidelity burn-down (the untouched dimension)

**Why:** avgRoleFidelity **0.833** is the laggard, and it has _never had a dedicated
campaign_ — it drifted up incidentally from 0.7505 (first measured, #365) to 0.833 as a
side effect of other work. The worst languages are the hard SOV/reorder set:
**hi 0.683 · qu 0.770 · bn 0.780 · ko 0.788 · ja/tr 0.793**. R1 measures
`action.role:valueType` recall — a parse that keeps the verb but drops or mistypes a role.

**Action:** triage R1 on hi/qu/bn first (worst three). For each, dump the role-signature
diff vs the en reference per pattern and find the recurring mistype/drop (likely a
marker→role mapping or a value-type classification in the per-language profile). This is
profile/parser work — but targeting _roles_, not _presence_. New `--regression` won't flag
drift here until someone drives it; this is greenfield headroom.

> **Triage DONE (2026-06-17) — the dominant cause is STRUCTURAL SOV, not dict-alignment.**
> A per-pattern role-signature diff (`action.role:valueType` recall vs en) across hi/qu/bn
> found the same two signals dominate all three: **`on.event:literal`** (hi 22×) and
> **`fetch.source:literal`** (hi/qu/bn **13× each**), with `repeat.loopType`/`repeat.event`
> (~7× each lang) and `halt.patient:literal` (6×) behind them. These are **not** independent
> dict gaps — they trace to ONE SOV root cause: when the SOV reorder fronts a **literal or
> expression** (a URL, a `fn()` call), the parser mistakes it for the **event** (hi parses
> `fetch /api/data` → `/api/data को लाएं` as `on /api/data … fetch`; `on click call myFunction()`
> → `myFunction()` becomes the event), or fails to match the bare SOV command at all (qu
> `/api/data ta apamuy` and bn `/api/data কে আনুন` return **NULL**). The control case proves it:
> when the fronted element is a **selector** (`on click toggle .active` → `.active को क्लिक पर
टॉगल`) the parse is **R1-perfect**. So selector-fronted SOV works; literal/expression-fronted
> SOV is mis-anchored. This is the **same structural frontier** as the deferred `tr
window-resize` hard-fail and the SOV behavior reorders — NOT the R0 dict-alignment family.

### Track 4 — Control-flow + long-tail lossy

> **DONE (2026-06-27) — the lossy band is empty (lossy → 0).** `unless-condition` (#501; three
> independent keyword/transform causes, NOT body-parse as framed) and the full long-tail
> (`fetch-do-not-throw` #481, `get-value` #498, `tell-*` #504, `set-color-variable` #497, `render`
> #502, `append` #503, the ar/qu/sw loop-body + ko if-fold residue #506) are all faithful. No
> control-flow / long-tail lossy passes remain in the priority corpus. Per-fix grounding:
> [`HANDOFF-lossy-tail.md`](HANDOFF-lossy-tail.md).

**Why:** `unless-condition` (8 lossy + 1 degen) is the largest non-behavior lossy pattern;
the docs' long-standing diagnosis is **control-flow body parsing** (`if`/`unless` headers +
then-chain `put`/`set` bodies collapsing). The rest is a singleton long tail
(`get-value` 4, `tell-*` 4, `set-color-variable` 4 — `fetch-do-not-throw` 5→0, cleared by the
fused-event if-block fold, PR #481).

**Action:** opportunistic, lower ROI than Tracks 1–2. Take `unless-condition` as the
representative and fix the enclosing block/then-chain collapse; the tail is per-pattern.
Defer the per-language R2 structural arcs (STRUCTURAL_ARCS_ROADMAP.md) — explicitly the
lowest-ROI remaining parse work.

### Track 5 — Reliability hygiene (do alongside, not after)

1. **Refresh stale headline numbers in the detailed docs.** _Partly done 2026-06-17:_ this
   file + a dated snapshot note added to CORRECTNESS_RELIABILITY_PLAN.md §1 and
   MULTILINGUAL_ROADMAP.md "Remaining work" pointing at the 06-17 baseline
   (lossy **94** / avgFidelity **0.985** / degenerate **29**). The prose bodies of those two
   docs still carry their original session-era figures inline — left as historical context,
   superseded by the dated snapshot + the baseline JSON (the authoritative source).
2. **Make `populate` deterministic.** CLAUDE.md flags the "minor residual jitter" on a few
   boundary patterns that forces the ratchet tolerances (3 lossy / 3 degen flips, 0.02 avg).
   A deterministic populate lets us tighten those tolerances toward 0 and trust the gate more.
3. **Consider an absolute fidelity floor**, not just a ratchet — once a language clears a
   threshold, ratchet the floor upward so it can't silently backslide within tolerance.
4. **hi precision follow-up.** hi avgPrecision **0.815** is a clear outlier (next-lowest ja ~0.91).
   The 2026-06-15 marker-disambiguation fix lifted it +0.016; more phantom-command sources
   remain in the hi profile. (Largely subsumed by Track 2 — the hi degenerate cluster is reactivity.)

## Runtime correctness follow-ups (core `_hyperscript`-compat — surfaced during Track 1a)

These are general core-runtime bugs (not multilingual) found while making the behavior
sources execute. The behaviors shipped via working idioms, so none are blocking — but each
is a real `_hyperscript` compatibility gap worth its own focused fix + test.

1. ~~**Top-level `on event(args)` doesn't bind event args.**~~ **DONE** (branch
   `fix/runtime-event-args-and-style`). The top-level parser emitted the destructure names as
   an untyped `params` field the runtime never read; now emits `args` (the field the runtime
   binds from + the behavior parser already uses). `on click(button)` etc. now bind.
2. ~~**`set my style.X` resolves to the read-only _computed_ style.**~~ **DONE** (same branch).
   The set member-assignment path now targets the writable inline `element.style` for
   `.style.<prop>` writes (reads unchanged). `set my style.width to "50px"` works; the
   Resizable `*width` idiom remains valid (not retrofitted — `*prop` is equally canonical).
3. **`closest <X/> to Y` positional returns null.** The positional `the closest <li/> to the
target` idiom yields null even when a match exists (`target.closest("li")` works). Lower
   priority — workaround is clean. Fix: the `closest <selector/> to <expr>` evaluator.

## Recommended sequence

1. ~~**Track 1a — eliminate imperative JS**~~ **DONE** (PRs #440–#442): Draggable/Sortable/Resizable
   compile from `source`; `imperativeInstaller` → 0. Runtime follow-ups #1 (event-args) + #2 (inline
   style) also **DONE** (#442); #3 (`closest`) deferred.
2. ~~**Track 1b — authoring guide**~~ **DONE** (#443, `packages/behaviors/AUTHORING.md`). The
   boundary **validator** is **skipped** for this stage (see item 3 above).
3. ~~**`behavior-removable` he/zh**~~ **DONE** (2026-06-17, PR #445). See Track 1 item 2.
4. ~~**Track 2 — reactivity in the multilingual parse path**~~ **7 of 8 hard-fails DONE**
   (PRs #446 ms `bind`×4 + hi keywords, #447 sw `input` event). Parse rate **3688 → 3695/3696**.
   Only `tr window-resize` remains — deferred as **structural SOV** (see Track 2 increment notes).
   The hi `live`/`intercept` bareKeyword block-shape work is the remaining genuine block-parser arc.
5. **Track 3 — R1 role-fidelity** triaged (2026-06-17): the laggard (hi 0.683 / qu 0.770 / bn 0.780)
   is **dominated by structural SOV mis-anchoring**, not dict-alignment (see the Track 3 triage
   note) — `on.event:literal` + `fetch.source:literal` are the top drops and both trace to "fronted
   literal/expression mistaken for the event / bare SOV command not matched."
6. **The convergent next arc — SOV bare-command / event-anchor disambiguation.** `tr window-resize`,
   the hi/qu/bn R1 laggard, and the SOV `fetch` NULLs are **one structural problem**. A focused arc
   here is now the highest-leverage remaining parser work — but it's regression-sensitive (hottest
   SOV path), so guard R0/precision/parse-rate carefully. Alternative if smaller wins are preferred:
   **Track 4** lossy long-tail (94 lossy ≫ the 1 remaining hard-fail).
