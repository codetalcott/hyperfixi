## Where we are (2026-07-06 baseline · post session-12 / L4 · `browser-priority`)

Authoritative source: `packages/testing-framework/baselines/multilingual-priority.json`
(its `timestamp` + `commit` fields stamp each regen). 24 langs × 154 patterns = 3696.

The six-signal ratchet gate is fully wired (parse-rate · degenerate · R0-recall ·
R0-precision · R1 · R2) — see CLAUDE.md "Multilingual parse rate ≠ fidelity".
**Direction now: stop adding gate signals; spend them down.** R1 remains the
dimension with headroom (SOV six ~0.95); R0-precision's spurious-action
families are the next un-mined seam.

## LAUNCH BAR (adopted 2026-07-06, post session 8)

Target for the publicized launch — **not** R1 = 1.0 (that tail is asymptotic;
the SOV-six role-typing subtleties past this bar are invisible in demos and
normal usage). The bar, all four together:

1. **All en-facing parser gaps closed.** Every remaining en-noise inversion is
   a real English-parser bug (en `go back` / `add "content"` didn't parse
   until #588/#589) — user-visible to English users regardless of the metric.
2. **Every spurious family larger than ×5 cleared** (post-session-12 inventory:
   ~~morph ×18~~ ✓L1, for ×14→×9 (transition half ✓L2; remainder = take-class
   ×6 own-arc + wait-payload behaviors ×3 post-launch), ~~add ×11 draggable~~
   ✓L1, ~~default ×9~~ ✓L4 (+before ×1 qu bonus), empty ×8, ~~call ×7~~ ✓L3,
   ~~on ×7 he~~ ✓L3, ~~transition ×6~~ ✓L2, ~~breakpoint ×6~~ ✓L2 (+halt ×3
   sibling). Remaining: for ×9, empty ×8.
3. **avgPrecision ≥ 0.995** — **REACHED session 12: 0.9953.** The six-signal
   gate holds it from here.
4. **avgRoleFidelity ≥ 0.985** (0.9838 as of session 12) — the big R1-missing
   families (add.patient:selector ×20, toggle.patient:expression ×19,
   fetch.source:literal ×18, set.patient:literal ×16,
   bind.source:property-path ×14) carry most of this.

Estimated **4–6 sessions** at the observed velocity (~30 A/B entries/session
across sessions 4–8, full discipline included). Sequencing:

| Session | Clusters                                                             | Bar signals moved         |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| L1 ✓    | morph ×18 + draggable add fold+cleanup ×11 (#590 + session-9 PR 2)   | precision 0.9891 → 0.9910 |
| L2 ✓    | breakpoint ×6+halt ×3 + bn `for` transition-half ×5 + transition ×6  | precision 0.9910 → 0.9928 |
| L3 ✓    | on ×7 he/hi (#595) + call ×7 halt-verb-guard (session-11 PR 2)       | precision 0.9928 → 0.9939 |
| L4 ✓    | default-value full drill (24 langs: schema markers + \_-fold)        | precision 0.9939 → 0.9953 |
| L5–L6   | big R1-missing families (add/toggle patient, fetch/bind source, set) | R1 → ≥0.985               |

L1 actual precision movement (+0.0019 for 29 entries) ran well under the
table's ~0.997 sketch — the remaining seven >×5 families plus the tail carry
more of the gap than estimated; expect the ≥0.995 bar to need L2 AND L3 (and
possibly part of L4) rather than L1+L2 alone. L2 actual: +0.0018 for 20
entries (#592, #593, session-10 PR 3) — on the same slope; after L2 the
remaining >×5 inventory is default ×9, for ×9 (two sub-arcs, see bar item 2),
empty ×8, call ×7, on ×7 he, so L3+L4 must carry ~0.0022 to reach 0.995.
L3 actual: +0.0011 for 14 spurious + 10 missing entries cleared (#595 +
session-11 PR 2) — remaining >×5 inventory is default ×9 (en-noise inversion,
the L4 drill), for ×9, empty ×8, so L4 must carry ~0.0011 to reach 0.995.
L4 actual: +0.0014 for 10 spurious cleared (default ×9 + the qu before ×1
bonus from the ñawpaq_kaq underscore fold) — **the ≥0.995 bar is reached**;
remaining >×5 inventory is for ×9 and empty ×8 (bar item 2), and L5–L6 carry
the R1 bar (0.9838 → ≥0.985).

**Post-launch track (ratchet-protected, not launch-blocking):** SOV-six role
polish (qu/hi ~0.956 R1), tr remove.patient block-walk leak, spurious empty
tr/hi/bn (transformer-side), wait-line param leak ja, SOV halt ×6, the R1
long tail. The six-signal gate holds the bar once reached — regressions
fail CI.

Caveats: each en enrichment can mint honest-dip entries (bounded by the
census/A-B discipline; historically <1 session total), and this scopes the
fidelity grind only — docs/demo/npm-publish polish is separate scope.

>
> - **#583 — then-boundary if fold (behavior-resizable en-noise).** A
>   mid-clause `if … then … end` block was split at its `then` CONJUNCTION by
>   parseBodyWithClauses: the if-head landed clause-final (fold nulls, flat if
>   truncates the condition), the branch became the next clause, and the owed
>   `end` desynced the walk — en broke at the 3rd of 4 clamp ifs and dropped
>   everything after. Opener-KIND stack: while an `if` is open mid-clause, a
>   conjunction is block content, so the whole block reaches the #576 fold.
>   bn's spurious set/trigger/if flags at resizable were en deficits —
>   the fourth consecutive en-noise inversion.
> - **#584 — event-head param-phrase (behavior-sortable).** `pointerdown(clientY)`
>   tokenizes as 4+ tokens, so the SOV event-marker check never fired; the `)`
>   anchored as the event and the leaked keyword-led `私 から` run killed the
>   handler set (and unbound `item` broke add.destination). Fixed at the HEAD:
>   param-phrase consumption (→ parameterNames), WAITABLE_EVENT_WORDS
>   recognition (guarded: after the `event` KEYWORD it's a loop payload),
>   rendered-`from me` pair stripping (trailing + qu fronted; new hi source
>   markers), fused method-call paren folding (`target.closest("li")`), and a
>   `the`-skip before keyword-base property access. 9 entries fixed
>   (set.patient ×4 + add.destination ×5), 0 new.
> - **Residue sharpened (full detail in the handoff session-6 block):**
>   sortable `remove.source ×12` is EN-NOISE (en's source slot rejects the
>   bare `item` identifier and DEFAULTS to `reference:"me"` — schema default,
>   probed in isolation; fix en's slot, but first check which languages pass
>   via the same default); `remove.patient ×3` es/pt/tr is an
>   of-possessive/from-marker ambiguity (needs a schema gate, not a marker
>   change); the wait-line param leak (ja trigger.source junk literal) is the

> block:
>
> - **`exit` bareKeyword** — roleless schemas generate NO pattern, so a

>   the fold rejected; the leftover predicate re-anchored as phantom `empty`
>   (behavior-sortable ar/id/sw/th ×4) and en itself dropped `exit` (bn/qu were
>   flagged "spurious exit" for parsing it correctly — en-noise again).
> - **ja/ko dict exit realign** 終了/종료 → profile primaries 退出/나가기 (the
>   historic exit/end collision words were inert identifiers when rendered).
> - **In-branch transition roles ×24 + qu standalone ×15** — verb-anchoring
>   path: destination→goal relabel (junk literal), patient literal→expression
>   retype, lone trailing TIME literal → duration reclaim.
> - **STRUCTURAL_NEVER_EVENT** — an event payload is never if/unless/else/end/
>   then (the SOV verb-first trigger swallowed the next clause's if-keyword).
> - **bn fold terminator** — শেষ (also bn positional `last`) now terminates
>   folds via normalized-form + selector-lookahead; bn conditionals no longer
>   swallow every trailing sibling.
> - **Residue sharpened:** behavior-sortable ja/ko `set` drop +
>   add.destination ×5 is an EVENT-HEAD param-phrase defect

>
> - **#580 — set of-possessive + A2 operator-run assembly.** The re-probe re-scoped
>   the plan (the #579 lesson repeating): set-color-variable ×11 was an

> - **Copula drill — spurious `empty` ×28 → ×12, mechanism NOT inverted** (en was

> - **#577 — transition family alignment (spurious ×66 → ×6, the largest precision

>    (SOV `-sov-patient-first`) or the primary role (**th `-vso` — th shares this root cause; it was

> 2. **Bare possessive particle, no normalized form, but COMMON** (over-match risk in other patterns):
>    ja `の`, ko `의`, bn `র`, hi `का`, th `ของ`. `の`/`의` especially are high-frequency — adding them
>    needs a full per-pattern A/B for phantom property-paths elsewhere.
> 3. **Recognized but the matcher DOESN'T FIRE under the full set-command context** — the deepest one:
>    ru `из`→`source` IS accepted by `isOfPossessiveMarker`, yet ru still parses
>    `set{destination:selector="*--primary-color"}` and DROPS `из #theme в "#ff6600"` (the destination
>    role greedily binds the bare `*--primary-color` selector and the of-possessive never assembles; the
>    trailing `из`/`в` then dangle and the patient drops). pl/uk likely share this. This is a role-ordering
>    / source-confusion interaction in `matchRoleToken`, NOT a missing marker — independent of (1)/(2).

> 3. **F3 — id/ms possessive keywords.** The i18n dict renders the reference `it` as id `miliknya` / ms
>    bare `nya` (not in the profiles' `possessive.keywords` — id had only `nya`/`dia`, ms had `-nya`

>   `fetch-json`, `fetch-with-headers`. The i18n transformer renders EN `it` as id `miliknya` / ms `nya`,
>   but the semantic profiles' `possessive.keywords` list only `nya`/`dia` (id) and `-nya`/`dia`/`ia`
>   (ms) — NOT the corpus forms. So `miliknya.error`/`nya.error` miss the possessive→property-path path

>   bare `nya:'it'` to ms) — but bare `nya` is a common clitic → over-match risk; gate it.
> - **ko (−0.0017) / qu (−0.0017): `window-keydown` condition `event.ctrlKey`.** In ISOLATION both EN
>   and ja/ko parse `if event.ctrlKey` → `condition:expression` (the condition is a raw span, NOT routed

> - **id/ms/vi: `behavior-sortable` (OFF-LIMITS) — the hard blocker.** EN's `target.closest("li")` is a

> - **`if-condition` (if.condition:expression 124× in the STALE-db map; structural) — ARC.** EN/es/ar
>   fold the `if/else` block (`conditional-X-folded`); de (V2 `wenn`) and SOV (ja/ko/hi) DON'T — the

> - **`accordion-toggle` (toggle.destination:expression 115×) — ARC.** EN `toggle .open on closest
.accordion-item` has a positional `on closest X` destination expression the translations drop in

>   divergence. No single clean slice.
> - **`wait-for-event` (wait.duration:literal 23×) — 3-WAY DISAGREEMENT, skip.** EN types the event
>   `transitionend` as `duration:literal`, de as `duration:expression`, ja as `duration:reference` —
>   no clear correct answer (and EN typing an event name as a "duration" is itself dubious).
> - **`for.loopType:literal` (23×) — LOW-VALUE.** EN's handcrafted `for-en-basic` sets a redundant

## The leverage map (what's actually non-faithful) — 2026-06-17

> **Snapshot — superseded by the 2026-06-21 baseline** (degenerate 9, lossy 53; see the

Of the **131** non-faithful instances (29 degenerate + 94 lossy + 8 hard-fail),
two clusters dominate:

| Cluster                                                                         | degenerate | lossy | hard-fail |  total |   share |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------: | ----: | --------: | -----: | ------: |
| **Behaviors** (removable/sortable/resizable/draggable + install)                |         18 |    47 |         0 | **65** | **50%** |
| **Reactivity** (bind-\* / live-\* / two-way / computed / intercept / window-\*) |          8 |     0 |         8 | **16** |     12% |
| **Control-flow** (`unless-condition` + then-chain bodies)                       |          1 |    10 |         0 |     11 |      8% |
| Long tail (get-value, tell-\*, set-color-variable, …)                           |          2 |    37 |         0 |     39 |     30% |

Per-pattern: `behavior-removable` 6 degen + 17 lossy (was 13 degen + 8 lossy + 2 hard) ·
`behavior-sortable` 9 degen + 14 lossy · `unless-condition` 1 degen + 8 lossy ·
`behavior-resizable` 1 degen + 8 lossy (was 21 lossy + 2 degen — the block-`if` fix) ·
`behavior-draggable` 8 lossy (was 23 lossy). **Hard fails were all reactivity** (ms `bind-*`×4,
sw `two-way-binding`/`computed-value`/`input-char-count`, tr `window-resize`); **PRs #446 + #447
cleared ms+sw (7 of 8)** — only `tr window-resize` remains (parse rate now **3695/3696**). See
the Track 2 increment notes below.

## Plan — ranked by leverage

### Track 1 (top priority) — Behaviors: curate the showcase, fix the curated bug, harden the _system_

**The goal is not comprehensiveness.** We are not shipping a large behavior library —
the priority is **getting the behavior _system_ right**: a clear path for the user
community and LLM agents to write and install new behaviors, with the curated set as a
showcase of _what a behavior is_ and _what kinds hyperfixi enables_. The product decision
already exists in [`packages/behaviors/src/curation.ts`](../packages/behaviors/src/curation.ts):

- **Curated 5 (the supported story):** Toggleable, **Removable**, ClickOutside, Clipboard,
  AutoDismiss — real `on event → DOM action` inline scripts (the demonstration of "what is a behavior").
- **Optional 3:** FocusTrap, ScrollReveal, Tabs — primitives / nice-to-haves.
- **Experimental 3:** Draggable, Sortable, Resizable — labeled "stateful async components."
  **But each already ships a complete hyperscript `source`** and is the _only_ tier still
  executed via an **imperative JS** `install()` that bypasses that source. So the label is
  provisional: the boundary test is operational, not philosophical (see item 1).

**Constraint (user, 2026-06-16): no behavior may be implemented in imperative JS — all must
compile from hyperscript `source` (single source of truth).** Audit (2026-06-16): only
Draggable/Sortable/Resizable violate this (`imperativeInstaller`); the other 8 are clean.

The fix is to **eliminate imperative JS first**, then align curation, then invest in the system:

> **Status: item 1 DONE (2026-06-16, branch `feat/behaviors-no-imperative-js`).** Draggable /
> Sortable / Resizable now compile from `source`; `imperativeInstaller` under behaviors/ = 0.
> Required: parser CSS-interp whitespace fix (merged #440), `repeat until event … from <target>`
> resolution fix (core `repeat.ts`), and three source-idiom swaps (Resizable `*width`, Sortable
> `target.closest("li")`, `or pointerup` in the inner waits). Three runtime bugs surfaced en route
> — see **Runtime correctness follow-ups** below. Items 2 (`behavior-removable`) and 3 (the system)
> remain.

1. **Resolve the Experimental 3 to hyperscript `source` — fix-vs-cut is per-behavior and
   runtime-driven, not a blanket cut.** Each already has real source; the imperative installer
   exists because the runtime historically couldn't execute the source's advanced features.
   So, per behavior: (a) run its `source` and see what the runtime drops — Draggable needs
   `repeat until event pointerup`, `wait for pointermove or pointerup from document`, `measure
x/y`, and dynamic `add { left: ${…}px }` style templating; (b) if the runtime executes it,
   **delete the imperative `install()` and route through `source`** (same path as the curated 8)
   — this both honors the no-imperative-JS rule _and_ makes the multilingual fidelity follow for
   free (parse of one source); (c) **cut only** the behavior whose source genuinely can't execute
   without a runtime feature too costly to add — and even then, prefer fixing the feature, since
   it's likely shared (`repeat-until-event` is already a tracked gate pattern). Start with
   Draggable (we had it working before; richest source) as the bellwether for Sortable/Resizable.
2. ~~**Fix `behavior-removable` — it is CURATED, so its failures are real bugs.**~~ **DONE**
   (2026-06-17, PR #445). Was the only behavior with **hard** parse failures (he/zh null parse).
   Two stacked bugs, both fixed: (a) the i18n transformer inserted a pre-positioned object marker
   before the behavior name in he/zh (`behavior את Removable` / `behavior 把 Removable`), breaking
   the semantic block parser's `tokens[1]` name detection — fixed by `resolveNameTokenIndex`
   skipping a leading patient-marker token ([`block-parser.ts`](../packages/semantic/src/parser/block-parser.ts));
   (b) `parseConditional` dropped the condition of block-style `if <cond>` (no inline `then`) in
   **all** non-English languages — fixed in [`transformer.ts`](../packages/i18n/src/grammar/transformer.ts).
   he/zh now parse 154/154 (lossy: he 0.556, zh 0.667). The condition fix is cross-language, so it
   rippled: `behavior-removable` degen→lossy in 7 other langs, draggable/resizable ~23 → 8–9
   non-faithful each, avgFidelity + avgRoleFidelity up everywhere, zero regressions. It is still
   6 degen + 17 lossy (the body sub-parse drops `trigger`/`remove`/`halt` after the conditionals) —
   a faithful pass is future headroom, not a regression. Remaining behavior debt is now
   `behavior-sortable` (9 degen + 14 lossy) and the Experimental-3 source execution (item 1).

3. **The actual priority — the authoring + install system for community & LLM agents:**
   - ~~**Authoring guide**~~ **DONE** (2026-06-16): `packages/behaviors/AUTHORING.md` — the
     canonical "what is a behavior / boundary test / how to write one / install + resolver /
     agent checklist" doc, for humans _and_ agents. Stale `core/BEHAVIORS.md` +
     `SORTABLE_BEHAVIOR_GUIDE.md` (old imperative architecture) replaced with redirects.
   - **Install path:** the resolver hook already works (`install X` → `_hyperscript.behaviors.resolve(X)`
     → compile-on-first-use, `packages/behaviors/src/behavior-resolver.ts`) — now documented in
     AUTHORING.md §7 as the public extension point.
   - **LLM-agent path (boundary _validator_) — SKIPPED for now** (decision 2026-06-16: too heavy
     for this stage of adoption). AUTHORING.md §9 already gives agents a boundary checklist; an
     MCP/programmatic validator that _enforces_ it (reject component-shaped behaviors) is deferred
     until adoption justifies the weight. Revisit when there's real third-party behavior authoring.

**Layer:** runtime (execute the Experimental-3 source + the Removable parse bug) + product
curation + DX/tooling (the system). **Owner docs:** `packages/behaviors/AUTHORING.md`,
MULTILINGUAL_BEHAVIORS_PLAN.md, BEHAVIORS_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md. **Audit cmd:** grep
`imperativeInstaller` under `packages/behaviors/src/behaviors/` — must reach 0.

### Track 2 — Reactivity: bring the multilingual parse path up to the runtime

> **htmx v4 syntax verified (2026-06-17, against four.htmx.org).** htmx v4 reactivity is the

> (Possible follow-up unrelated to the gate: hyperfixi's SSE/WS compat uses the htmx-2-era
> `sse-connect`/`ws-connect` attribute names; htmx v4 ships these as the `hx-sse`/`hx-ws`

**Decision (settled): reactivity is in scope and must be supported in the multilingual path.**
This is a parser/profile build-out, not an exclusion.

**Remaining: 1 hard fail + hi block cluster — precise diagnoses (deferred, each its own arc):**

1. **tr `window-resize` (the last hard-fail).** Two stacked issues. (a) The sw-style event-name
   gap, but worse: the i18n transformer emits `boyut_değiştir` for `resize`, and the tr tokenizer
   **splits on `_`** → `boyut` / `_` / `değiştir`, where `değiştir` alone normalizes to **`toggle`**
   (collision). So the resize event is destroyed, not just unrecognized. The click form
   (`tıklama`, single token) parses identically, so a single-token resize recognition is the core
   fix — but it needs the underscore-split resolved (cf. the `enyakın` fused-token fix), likely an
   i18n-side single-word resize emission + tr tokenizer entry. (b) Independently, the `debounced
at 200ms` event modifier is left untranslated and fronted by the SOV reorder. Both needed for
   the full gate pattern. 1 hard-fail, ~2 fixes — lower ROI than the hi block cluster.

   > **Data point (2026-06-21, ru/uk install-behavior).** The same underscore-split bit ru/uk
   > `install`: the profile's disambiguator `установить_пакет` / `встановити_пакет` was inert
   > because the ru/uk tokenizer splits on `_` → `установить` → `set` (install ≡ set homonym),

   > semantic profile + i18n dict (degenerate 6 → 4, zero regressions). For tr `window-resize`,
   > the equivalent single-token route would be a non-underscore resize keyword that doesn't
   > collide with `toggle` — likely cleaner than teaching the tr tokenizer to keep `_`-compounds
   > whole. The `debounced at 200ms` modifier is the separate, harder half.

2. **hi `live-derived-value` / `live-multiple-deps` (degenerate); also `intercept` blocks.** The
   genuine **reactive block-shape** work: `live`/`intercept` (and `eventsource`/`socket`/
   `worker`) are `bareKeyword` blocks (`hasBody:true`), but `block-parser.ts` only handles
   `behavior`/`def`. In non-English the `live … end` / `intercept … end` block parses as a bare
   `on`, dropping the block action. Teach the block layer the bareKeyword block shape (mirrors
   the behavior/`def` structural layer).

**Layer:** (1) sw semantic parser/tokenizer · (2) i18n transformer (SOV event reorder + modifier
xlate) · (3) semantic block-parser (bareKeyword blocks). Start with (1) — most leverage, cleanest
scope.

### Track 3 — R1 role-fidelity burn-down (the untouched dimension)

**Why:** avgRoleFidelity **0.833** is the laggard, and it has _never had a dedicated
campaign_ — it drifted up incidentally from 0.7505 (first measured, #365) to 0.833 as a
side effect of other work. The worst languages are the hard SOV/reorder set:
**hi 0.683 · qu 0.770 · bn 0.780 · ko 0.788 · ja/tr 0.793**. R1 measures
`action.role:valueType` recall — a parse that keeps the verb but drops or mistypes a role.

**Action:** triage R1 on hi/qu/bn first (worst three). For each, dump the role-signature
diff vs the en reference per pattern and find the recurring mistype/drop (likely a
marker→role mapping or a value-type classification in the per-language profile). This is
profile/parser work — but targeting _roles_, not _presence_. New `--regression` won't flag
drift here until someone drives it; this is greenfield headroom.

> **Triage DONE (2026-06-17) — the dominant cause is STRUCTURAL SOV, not dict-alignment.**
> A per-pattern role-signature diff (`action.role:valueType` recall vs en) across hi/qu/bn
> found the same two signals dominate all three: **`on.event:literal`** (hi 22×) and
> **`fetch.source:literal`** (hi/qu/bn **13× each**), with `repeat.loopType`/`repeat.event`
> (~7× each lang) and `halt.patient:literal` (6×) behind them. These are **not** independent
> dict gaps — they trace to ONE SOV root cause: when the SOV reorder fronts a **literal or
> expression** (a URL, a `fn()` call), the parser mistakes it for the **event** (hi parses
> `fetch /api/data` → `/api/data को लाएं` as `on /api/data … fetch`; `on click call myFunction()`
> → `myFunction()` becomes the event), or fails to match the bare SOV command at all (qu
> `/api/data ta apamuy` and bn `/api/data কে আনুন` return **NULL**). The control case proves it:
> when the fronted element is a **selector** (`on click toggle .active` → `.active को क्लिक पर
टॉगल`) the parse is **R1-perfect**. So selector-fronted SOV works; literal/expression-fronted
> SOV is mis-anchored. This is the **same structural frontier** as the deferred `tr
window-resize` hard-fail and the SOV behavior reorders — NOT the R0 dict-alignment family.

### Track 4 — Control-flow + long-tail lossy

> **DONE (2026-06-27) — the lossy band is empty (lossy → 0).** `unless-condition` (#501; three
> independent keyword/transform causes, NOT body-parse as framed) and the full long-tail
> (`fetch-do-not-throw` #481, `get-value` #498, `tell-*` #504, `set-color-variable` #497, `render`
> #502, `append` #503, the ar/qu/sw loop-body + ko if-fold residue #506) are all faithful. No
> control-flow / long-tail lossy passes remain in the priority corpus. Per-fix grounding:
> [`HANDOFF-lossy-tail.md`](HANDOFF-lossy-tail.md).

**Why:** `unless-condition` (8 lossy + 1 degen) is the largest non-behavior lossy pattern;
the docs' long-standing diagnosis is **control-flow body parsing** (`if`/`unless` headers +
then-chain `put`/`set` bodies collapsing). The rest is a singleton long tail
(`get-value` 4, `tell-*` 4, `set-color-variable` 4 — `fetch-do-not-throw` 5→0, cleared by the
fused-event if-block fold, PR #481).

**Action:** opportunistic, lower ROI than Tracks 1–2. Take `unless-condition` as the
representative and fix the enclosing block/then-chain collapse; the tail is per-pattern.
Defer the per-language R2 structural arcs (STRUCTURAL_ARCS_ROADMAP.md) — explicitly the
lowest-ROI remaining parse work.

### Track 5 — Reliability hygiene (do alongside, not after)

1. **Refresh stale headline numbers in the detailed docs.** _Partly done 2026-06-17:_ this
   file + a dated snapshot note added to CORRECTNESS_RELIABILITY_PLAN.md §1 and
   MULTILINGUAL_ROADMAP.md "Remaining work" pointing at the 06-17 baseline
   (lossy **94** / avgFidelity **0.985** / degenerate **29**). The prose bodies of those two
   docs still carry their original session-era figures inline — left as historical context,
   superseded by the dated snapshot + the baseline JSON (the authoritative source).
2. **Make `populate` deterministic.** CLAUDE.md flags the "minor residual jitter" on a few
   boundary patterns that forces the ratchet tolerances (3 lossy / 3 degen flips, 0.02 avg).
   A deterministic populate lets us tighten those tolerances toward 0 and trust the gate more.
3. **Consider an absolute fidelity floor**, not just a ratchet — once a language clears a
   threshold, ratchet the floor upward so it can't silently backslide within tolerance.
4. **hi precision follow-up.** hi avgPrecision **0.815** is a clear outlier (next-lowest ja ~0.91).
   The 2026-06-15 marker-disambiguation fix lifted it +0.016; more phantom-command sources
   remain in the hi profile. (Largely subsumed by Track 2 — the hi degenerate cluster is reactivity.)

## Runtime correctness follow-ups (core `_hyperscript`-compat — surfaced during Track 1a)

These are general core-runtime bugs (not multilingual) found while making the behavior
sources execute. The behaviors shipped via working idioms, so none are blocking — but each
is a real `_hyperscript` compatibility gap worth its own focused fix + test.

1. ~~**Top-level `on event(args)` doesn't bind event args.**~~ **DONE** (branch
   `fix/runtime-event-args-and-style`). The top-level parser emitted the destructure names as
   an untyped `params` field the runtime never read; now emits `args` (the field the runtime
   binds from + the behavior parser already uses). `on click(button)` etc. now bind.
2. ~~**`set my style.X` resolves to the read-only _computed_ style.**~~ **DONE** (same branch).
   The set member-assignment path now targets the writable inline `element.style` for
   `.style.<prop>` writes (reads unchanged). `set my style.width to "50px"` works; the
   Resizable `*width` idiom remains valid (not retrofitted — `*prop` is equally canonical).
3. **`closest <X/> to Y` positional returns null.** The positional `the closest <li/> to the
target` idiom yields null even when a match exists (`target.closest("li")` works). Lower
   priority — workaround is clean. Fix: the `closest <selector/> to <expr>` evaluator.

## Recommended sequence

1. ~~**Track 1a — eliminate imperative JS**~~ **DONE** (PRs #440–#442): Draggable/Sortable/Resizable
   compile from `source`; `imperativeInstaller` → 0. Runtime follow-ups #1 (event-args) + #2 (inline
   style) also **DONE** (#442); #3 (`closest`) deferred.
2. ~~**Track 1b — authoring guide**~~ **DONE** (#443, `packages/behaviors/AUTHORING.md`). The
   boundary **validator** is **skipped** for this stage (see item 3 above).
3. ~~**`behavior-removable` he/zh**~~ **DONE** (2026-06-17, PR #445). See Track 1 item 2.
4. ~~**Track 2 — reactivity in the multilingual parse path**~~ **7 of 8 hard-fails DONE**
   (PRs #446 ms `bind`×4 + hi keywords, #447 sw `input` event). Parse rate **3688 → 3695/3696**.
   Only `tr window-resize` remains — deferred as **structural SOV** (see Track 2 increment notes).
   The hi `live`/`intercept` bareKeyword block-shape work is the remaining genuine block-parser arc.
5. **Track 3 — R1 role-fidelity** triaged (2026-06-17): the laggard (hi 0.683 / qu 0.770 / bn 0.780)
   is **dominated by structural SOV mis-anchoring**, not dict-alignment (see the Track 3 triage
   note) — `on.event:literal` + `fetch.source:literal` are the top drops and both trace to "fronted
   literal/expression mistaken for the event / bare SOV command not matched."
6. **The convergent next arc — SOV bare-command / event-anchor disambiguation.** `tr window-resize`,
   the hi/qu/bn R1 laggard, and the SOV `fetch` NULLs are **one structural problem**. A focused arc
   here is now the highest-leverage remaining parser work — but it's regression-sensitive (hottest
   SOV path), so guard R0/precision/parse-rate carefully. Alternative if smaller wins are preferred:
   **Track 4** lossy long-tail (94 lossy ≫ the 1 remaining hard-fail).

> - **Complex multi-clause SOV `fetch` — ✅ R0 set-drop resolved (PR #481, #480).**
>   `fetch-do-not-throw` (`fetch … as JSON do not throw then if it set $users to it end`) is now
>   **faithful in all priority langs** (was lossy in bn/hi/ja/ko/tr). #480 stripped the phantom
>   `throw`; #481 made the fused-event body **fold its trailing `if … end` block** and recover the
>   verb-medial `set` in the then-branch (`parseBodyWithGrammarPatterns`), and scoped the
>   verb-anchoring particle guard to known role markers so the `set`-value marker (`に`) no longer
>   anchors a phantom `into`. The same root-cause fold also cleared `fetch-error-handling`,
>   `form-disable-on-submit`, `modal-close-escape` (1→0 each) and `take-class-from-siblings` (2→1).
>   Any remaining qu/bn `fetch.source` **role-typing** slice (R1 — mis-typed `fetch.patient` via
>   verb-anchoring) is a separate matter; the `fetch`→`source` verb-anchoring remap tried earlier
>   proved **inert** on the corpus and was dropped.

Re-baseline (`--save-baseline`) after each intentional fidelity change, regenerate against a
freshly `populate`d DB, and commit only the dicts/profiles + baseline (not `patterns.db`).
