# Scope: foreign→English validity — the expression-internal translation gap

**Status:** Phases 1a, 1b and 3 shipped (foreign validity 90.7 % → **93.7 %**; see
Phasing below). Phase 2 (operators + copula) is the whole remaining burndown.
Companion to the foreign→English canonical-validity
gate (`packages/testing-framework/src/multilingual/foreign-canonical-validity.ts`,
baseline `baselines/foreign-canonical-validity.json`). The gate makes the number below
visible and ratcheted; this doc scopes the burndown so it can be prioritized against
the learn/book roadmap (per the business plan, engine hygiene is "when it's the focus,"
not drop-everything).

## The number

Foreign→English render validity across the 23 non-English priority languages:
**90.7 % (2,775 / 3,059)** authored translations render English the real
`hyperscript.org` parser accepts. The other **~9.3 % (284 (pattern, language) pairs
across 23 patterns)** render English it rejects. For a language toolchain this is the
gap between "trustworthy" and "mostly works" — an LLM agent can't tell which 9 % is
wrong, so the whole surface reads as unreliable.

## One root cause, not twenty

A triage of all 23 failing patterns (one representative language each) found the
failures are **not** a spread of independent renderer bugs — they are overwhelmingly
**one root cause: expression-internal vocabulary is never translated to English.**
The command STRUCTURE and role MARKERS translate fine (the fidelity ratchet scores
~1.0); but the *insides* of expressions, conditions, and possessives are captured as
opaque foreign text and emitted verbatim.

Representative renders (foreign → our "English"), with the leaked foreign word in bold:

| Pattern | Rendered "English" | Untranslated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `two-way-binding` | `set … to "Hello, " + `**`لي قيمة`** | `my value` |
| `computed-value` | `… to ( the `**`قيمة من`**` #price `**`كـ`**` Number ) * …` | `value of … as` |
| `if-empty` | `if `**`me قيمة`**` is empty …` (also `me`, not `my`) | `value` |
| `input-mirror` | `put `**`my قيمة`**` into #preview` (parses valid, semantically wrong) | `value` |
| `focus-trap` | `if target `**`coincide`**` last <button/> `**`en`**` .modal …` | `matches`, `in` |
| `if-exists` | `if #modal `**`موجود`**` show #modal …` | `exists` |
| `modal-close-backdrop` | `if target `**`يطابق`**` .modal-backdrop hide …` | `matches` |
| `behavior-removable` | `… if it `**`it`**` "cancel" …` (copula `is`→`it`) | `is` (هو is ambiguous) |
| `last-in-collection` | `scroll to last <.message/> `**`destination`**` #chat` | `in` (see below) |

The Arabic/CJK cases surface as a hard `Unknown token: <char>` throw (the leaked word
is non-Latin); the Latin-script cases (`en`, `coincide`, `mi valor`) surface as a
parse error or a silently-wrong identifier.

### Why it happens (mechanics)

Two related mechanisms in `packages/semantic/src/parser/`:

1. **Expression values are captured as raw foreign text.** A value/condition role
   (`"Hello, " + my value`, `my value is empty`, `value of #price as Number`) is
   captured with `joinTokenText` (`semantic-parser.ts`), which joins the surface
   tokens. Keyword tokens contribute their `normalized` form, but ordinary
   identifiers/operators inside the expression pass through verbatim — and the
   normalized form of a **role marker** is the **role name**, not the English word.
   So `en` (Spanish "in") → `destination` (its role concept), not `in`; that is the
   `last-in-collection` `scroll to … destination #chat` bug — a mis-normalization at
   parse, not a render fallback.

2. **Expression-internal keywords have no foreign→English map.** `value`, `matches`,
   `exists`, `is empty`, `of`, `as`, the copula `is` — these are LokaScript vocabulary
   with per-language surface forms (`valor`, `coincide`, `موجود`, `من`, `كـ`), but the
   render path has no lexicon to map the parsed foreign surface back to the English
   keyword. Possessive property names (`my value` → `mi valor`) are the most common:
   the possessive *marker* translates (`mi`→`my`) but the *property* does not
   (`valor`→`value` is never applied).

The through-line: **LokaScript translates at the command/role granularity, but an
expression is a leaf it treats as opaque.** Closing the gap means teaching the
expression layer the same bidirectional vocabulary the command layer already has.

## What has to translate

From the triage, the missing coverage is a bounded vocabulary, not arbitrary text:

- **Possessive property names** — `value`, `innerText`, `innerHTML`, `checked`, … (the
  single biggest family: `two-way-binding`, `if-empty`, `input-mirror`, `input-validation`,
  `computed-value`).
- **Comparison / existence operators** — `matches`, `is`, `is empty`, `exists`, `is not`,
  `contains` (`focus-trap`, `if-exists`, `modal-close-backdrop`, the `is`→`it` copula).
- **Expression connectives** — `of`, `in`, `as` (`computed-value`, `last-in-collection`).
- **Value/positional keywords inside expressions** — `value of X`, `last/first … in …`.

All of these already exist as per-language keywords for *command* parsing; they are
simply not consulted when rendering an expression back to English.

## Approach options

1. **Translate expression internals at parse time (capture → normalize to English).**
   When capturing an expression/condition value, tokenize it and map each keyword/
   operator/property token through the existing per-language keyword tables to its
   English form, keeping code-shaped tokens (selectors, `$vars`, string/number
   literals, member paths) verbatim. Pro: the stored value is already English, so
   render is unchanged and the AST-execution path benefits too. Con: touches the hot
   expression-capture path; must be careful not to translate inside string literals or
   code identifiers.

2. **Bidirectional lexicon applied at render.** Keep the raw foreign expression in the
   value, and translate keyword tokens to English only in the renderer. Pro: isolated
   to the render path (parse untouched → fidelity ratchet can't move). Con: the
   AST-execution path still holds foreign expressions; duplicates tokenization at
   render.

Both need the same missing asset: **a single concept→language→surface lexicon** that
the expression layer can query bidirectionally. This is exactly the "single lexicon
(concept→lang→translation)" aspiration already noted for the framework↔semantic vocab
tooling — this effort is its most concrete, highest-value driver. Building it once
serves parsing, rendering, and the vocab-authoring backlog together.

**Recommendation:** option 1 (translate at parse), because it fixes both production
paths (the transpiler's foreign→English AND the semantic bundle's foreign→AST→execute)
with one change, and keeps the renderer simple. Gate it behind the lexicon so the
same table drives command and expression translation.

## Phasing (proposed)

1. **Lexicon + possessive properties.** Build/extend the bidirectional keyword lexicon;
   apply it to possessive property names first (`value`, `innerText`, …). Clears the
   largest family (~6 patterns × ~20 langs). Re-run the foreign gate; prune the cleared
   pairs from the allowlist.

   **1a — property-path possessives — SHIPPED.** The reverse property-name lexicon
   lives in `packages/semantic/src/parser/utils/expression-lexicon.ts` (surfaces copied
   from the i18n dicts by `packages/i18n/scripts/extract-property-lexicon.ts`, since
   semantic is upstream of i18n). `PatternMatcher.toEnglishProperty` normalizes the
   property HEAD in all four possessive matchers (of-, pre-nominal, post-nominal,
   selector-possessive), so `my valor`/`私の 値`/`#picker's قيمة` capture property
   `value`. Cleared **24 pairs** (`input-mirror` + `bind-explicit-property`, 12 langs
   each); foreign validity 90.7 % → **91.5 %** (2799/3059). Fidelity ratchet unmoved
   (property names aren't scored by R0–R3), so no multilingual-priority baseline regen.
   Note: `value` is the only property the i18n dicts translate today, so `innerHTML`/
   `textContent`/`checked` pass through as identity; the lexicon also carries
   `checked`/`length`/`disabled`/`hidden` for languages that translate them, ready for
   future corpus rows.

   **1b — property names inside RAW expressions — SHIPPED** (with Phase 3, below).
   `two-way-binding` (`"Hello, " + mi valor`), `input-validation` / `if-empty`
   (`mi valor is empty`), `computed-value` (`valor de #price como Number`) hold the
   property inside a captured raw-expression string, not a property-path node — so 1a
   doesn't reach them.

   Two seams fed those captures, not one: the conditional's `joinTokenText`
   (`semantic-parser.ts`, keyword → `normalized`, else verbatim) and the operator-run
   join (`pattern-matcher.ts`, **fully** verbatim, and missing the `.`-glue rule).
   Both now route through the shared `joinExpressionTokens` in
   `parser/utils/expression-lexicon.ts`.

   The possessive-pronoun fix reuses what already existed: **English's own profile
   declares `specialForms: { me:'my', it:'its', you:'your' }`**, so
   `getEnglishPossessiveAdjective` (beside `getPossessiveReference`, the inverse
   direction) reads it rather than hard-coding a table. References without an
   adjective (`result`/`event`/`target`/`body`) fall through to `'s`.

   **Translation is anchored, never blanket** — this is the load-bearing safety
   property, since a raw expression has none of the slot guarantees 1a relied on:
   a possessive is only read as one when a property head actually follows it. That
   requirement is not cosmetic — ms `ia` and qu `chay` are BOTH the possessive
   (`its`) and the bare reference (`it`), so translating on sight rewrote `if it`
   into the invalid `if its` and broke `fetch-do-not-throw` in both languages
   (caught by the gate's ADDED count, now 0).

2. **Operators + copula — the whole remaining burndown.** See the corrected taxonomy
   below; this is now ~130 of the ~194 residual pairs.
3. **Connectives + positional-in-expression — SHIPPED** (with 1b). `of`/`as` and
   `last/first … in …`.

   - `of` is emitted **structurally** by an of-possessive anchor
     (`<property> <of-marker> <selector>` → `value of #price`), never by surface
     lookup: es spells `of` and `from` the same `de`, so a free-token translation
     would corrupt `from` clauses.
   - `as` comes from a generated `CONNECTIVE_LEXICON` with an **ambiguity guard**
     (a surface the language reuses for any other sense, in any dict bucket, is
     dropped) — th `เป็น` is both `as` and the copula `is`, and carrying it would
     have rewritten every Thai `is` condition.
   - The locative needed both a role-concept map and a generated `LOCATIVE_SURFACES`
     set, because the markers fail three different ways: es `en` normalizes to the
     ROLE NAME (`destination`), zh `在`/tr `içinde`/id `dalam` are not role markers at
     all and leaked verbatim, and pt `dentro` normalizes to English `into` (which the
     canonical parser rejects in this slot). No ambiguity guard is needed there — the
     slot fixes the sense.
4. **Residual language-specific parse gaps** (not vocab): `swap-content` (ar `بـ#b`
   fusion), the sparse rows. Small, per-language.
5. **Leave deferred:** `pick-text-range` (named R1 deferral).

Each phase is gate-guarded (foreign-canonical-validity), fidelity-ratchet-guarded, and
en-gate-guarded, exactly like the en-render burndown (#699–#704). Target: 90.7 % →
high-90s, residual = named deferrals.

## Where the burndown stands (after 1a + 1b + 3)

**93.7 % (2865/3059); 194 pairs across 19 patterns.** 1b+3 cleared 66:

| Pattern | before | after | blocked on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `two-way-binding` | 23 | 1 | id |
| `computed-value` | 23 | 4 | hi/id/th/zh (see below) |
| `last-in-collection` | 13 | 2 | bn/tr |
| `input-validation` | 21 | 14 | **Phase 2 copula** |
| `if-empty` | 21 | 14 | **Phase 2 copula** + the i18n scramble |

`input-validation` and `if-empty` now have the SAME residual set (ar bn fr hi id ja ms
pt qu ru th tl tr uk) — the copula-`is` set exactly. Their property/pronoun vocabulary is
fixed; only `is` still leaks. So `if-empty`'s i18n word-order scramble is no longer the
front blocker: **Phase 2 is.**

Known, accepted residuals in shipped code:

- **hi `के_रूप_में` never matches** — the tokenizer splits underscore-joined dictionary
  surfaces. Same class as id `tidak_ada`, qu `mana_kanchu`, tl `hindi_pinagana`. The
  dead entries are harmless (an unlisted surface passes through), but the class is real
  and also affects Phase 1a's `tl` property entries.
- **th `เป็น` is deliberately omitted** by the connective ambiguity guard (it is also
  the copula `is`). Correct conservatism, not an oversight.

## Corrected Phase 2 taxonomy (triage, 2026-07-16)

The phasing above left **49 pairs unassigned to any phase**. They are all Phase 2, and
they name three families the original list omits:

- `form-submit-prevent` (13) — pure copula `is` (`if result is false`). Its pass list is
  *exactly* the 9 languages carrying a `normalized:'is'` registration, plus `he` (whose
  dict has no `is` entry, so it authors literal English). `CONDITION_COPULAS_SURFACE`
  (`semantic-parser.ts`) already enumerates 12 of the 13 failing surfaces — a ready-made
  map, currently used only to suppress a condition split.
- `behavior-draggable` (20) — the operator **`no`** (`if no dragHandle`), which the
  Phase 2 list above omits. 19 dicts define `no:`; the 3 passers (he/th/vi) don't. +bn
  (a separate transformer scramble, Phase 4).
- `behavior-sortable` (16) — copula (13) + id underscore-split + ko/zh `document`.

**Three families to add to Phase 2:**

1. **`no`** — an existence/negation operator, sibling of `exists`/`is empty`.
2. **Context globals** (`document`, `window`, `body`) — **zero** reverse coverage today:
   no `normalized:'document'` registration exists anywhere in `packages/semantic`. Benign
   on Latin scripts (es leaks `documento` and still passes) but fatal on CJK/Arabic
   (`Unknown token: 文`).
3. **Underscore-joined dict surfaces** — see the hi note above.

## Why there were no "quick wins"

The initial hypothesis was that a subset of the 23 were pure renderer bugs (role-marker
leaks) skimmable ahead of the deep work. Investigation disproved it: `last-in-collection`
is an expression mis-normalization (parse), `swap-content` is a language-specific fusion
(parse) — both the deep problem, not render fallbacks. There is no cheap tier to peel
off first; the gap is one coherent effort. That is itself the useful scoping result:
**don't budget this as a handful of PRs — budget it as the lexicon + a 4-phase burndown.**
