## Read this before triaging anything below

**Which entries are load-bearing.** Two of these are protected by a gate that
fails loudly on its own; the rest can be lost entirely. Know which you are
looking at before deciding what to work on — and do **not** "tidy up" the gated
ones, because the gate *is* the tracking mechanism.

| Item | Severity | Gate | Detail |
| ---- | -------- | ---- | ------ |
| **`tell` never consumes a terminating `end`** | medium — no real `tell … end` block form; upstream requires one | **none** | comment at `packages/core/src/parser/command-parsers/utility-commands.ts` (the `ELSE`/`END` break in `parseTellCommand`) |
| **Nothing executes a shipped example** | medium — `examples/**` is parsed but never run | **none** | "Wider question" in [HANDOFF-if-block-then-separator.md](HANDOFF-if-block-then-separator.md) |
| `and` is not a command separator anywhere | low — consistent everywhere, so no surprise | ✅ 2 `KNOWN GAP` tests | `packages/core/src/parser/__tests__/then-as-separator.test.ts` |
| `sortable-list.html` recovers with errors | low — one shipped example | ✅ allowlist ratchet | `packages/testing-framework/baselines/shipped-sources-validity.json` |

### Why the gated two need no doc to survive

- **`and`** — the two `KNOWN GAP` tests assert the *current, wrong* shape. Anyone
  who fixes the pratt parser breaks them immediately and is forced to decide
  deliberately. That is the intended design; the tests are not stale assertions.
- **`sortable-list.html`** — the allowlist key embeds `sha1(source)`, and
  assertion 3 of the shipped-sources gate **fails** when an allowlisted source
  goes clean. The list can only ratchet down. It cannot be silently forgotten.

The ungated two have no such mechanism. **They are what this document is for.**

## Notes on the ungated two

**Expression-first condition parsing** is the deferred follow-on from the `if`
family (see History). #786 replaced the raw "is this token spelled like a
command?" test with a positional approximation (`isBodyCommandStart`: first-token
exemption, operand rule, chain rule), which fixed every measured shape — but it is
still a heuristic. The residual it leaves is LOW and known: a command-word in a
mid-condition position that is neither first nor operator-preceded (e.g. after a
possessive, `if x's set is 3` + newline body) can still mislead the form scans.
The real fix parses the condition via `parseExpression()` from token zero and
classifies the form from what follows — viable, since the pratt parser accepts
command-word operands (`add is 3` parses cleanly). Fold the residual into that
work rather than extending `OPERAND_INTRODUCERS` piecemeal. Detail + the
regression episode that motivates it:
[HANDOFF-command-word-in-if-condition.md](HANDOFF-command-word-in-if-condition.md).

**No execution test for `examples/**`** is the systemic one. #785 added
`packages/core/src/api/if-body-then-execution.test.ts`, which is the right shape
(compile, run in jsdom, assert the DOM) but only covers hand-written sources. The
R2 execution ratchet does this for 47 curated corpus patterns
(`avgExecutionFidelity`); extending something like it to `examples/**` is the
natural follow-on. It is what would have caught the #785 defect on *behaviour*
rather than on a diagnostic — `native-dialog.html` shipped with its conditional
body running unconditionally and every parse-level gate was green.

## History

- **2026-07-27 (#786, repair commit)** — command-name words in `if`/`unless`
  conditions (`if log is 3 add .a` died with "Expected condition"; in a handler
  the `if` vanished and its body ran unconditionally, `ok: true`). Fixed by
  replacing the spelling test with command **position** (`isBodyCommandStart` +
  an unguarded first condition parse). The same commit repaired **five
  upstream-valid shapes the two entries below had regressed vs main** — their
  bounds were built on the same broken classifier, and every gate stayed green
  through it because no in-repo source uses command-word conditions. The
  `hasThen` bound became the command-CHAIN rule (same-line then-joined bodies
  bind; a command starting a later line breaks the chain). Full episode:
  [HANDOFF-command-word-in-if-condition.md](HANDOFF-command-word-in-if-condition.md).
- **2026-07-27** — the `hasThen` residual of the entry below: a single-line `if`
  whose FOLLOWING line carried a body `then` was still swallowed, because that
  lookahead crosses newlines. First bounded at the first command — over-corrected,
  see the entry above — and settled as the chain rule; the `commandToken.line`
  bound #785 considered stays rejected, since a header `then` may sit on the line
  after the condition.
- **2026-07-27** — implicit-multiline `if` swallowing the following line into its
  block. The lookahead answered the "FIRST command's line" question correctly and
  then kept walking, so the second command overrode the answer; it is now bounded
  to the `if`'s own line once that first command is found, which preserves the
  same-line `else`/`end` hunt the missing `break` exists for. Brief:
  [HANDOFF-implicit-multiline-if.md](HANDOFF-implicit-multiline-if.md) (read its
  RESOLVED header — one residual stays open, at the top of the table above).
- **#785** (2026-07-27) — `then` as a command separator in `if`/`unless`, `def` /
  `init` / `catch` / `finally`, and `tell` bodies; `--` comments in `if` bodies;
  shipped-sources allowlist 4 → 1. Brief:
  [HANDOFF-if-block-then-separator.md](HANDOFF-if-block-then-separator.md)
  (carries two corrections to its own original triage — read its header).
- **#784** — shipped-sources validity gate + `ParseResult.recovered`. Brief:
  [HANDOFF-parse-success-and-doc-examples.md](HANDOFF-parse-success-and-doc-examples.md).
- 2026-01-30 — behavior parameters shadowing command names. **Resolved**;
