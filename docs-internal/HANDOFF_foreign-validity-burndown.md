# Handoff: foreign→English validity burndown (post Phase 12 — blocked-vocab class CLEARED)

Paste the block below into a fresh session to continue the arc. Everything above the
`---` is orientation for a human; the prompt itself starts after it.

**Arc state:** Phases 1a (#707), 1b + 3 (#711), **2 (the operator/copula slice, #718)**,
**4 (`no` + `references` drift + the condition locative, #719)**, **5 (the context
globals `document`/`window`/`detail`, #721)**, **6 (the `as` connective zh/hi + the
`beep!` possessive glue+leak, #723)**, **7 (three structural fixes: id `punya`
possessive-in-expression, focus-trap event-source-leak drop, swap SOV patient-first
with-word binding, #724)**, **8 (modal-close-escape pl/uk — hide's literal-only
`style` slot rejecting a reference, #725)**, **9 (qu/ru/uk null/undefined value-literals
the tokenizer never bound)**, **10 (id/ko undefined value-literals + the qu
connector-joined dot-member possessive, #726)**, **11 (10 pairs across seven root
causes — see the PHASE 11 block below)**, **11b (swap ar/tl, the last structural
sub-bug — see § "What Phase 11 left")**, and **12 (the ambiguous-sense anchor — the
ENTIRE deliberately-blocked vocab class, 24 pairs, one mechanism)** shipped.
Foreign→English render validity **90.7 % → 3036/3059 (≈99.2 %)**. **23 pairs across 1
pattern** remain: the residual is exactly pick-text-range (the ~3-arc deferral). The
"deliberately blocked" class no longer exists.
Companion scope doc: `docs-internal/EXPRESSION_INTERNAL_TRANSLATION_SCOPE.md`. Memory:

> **PHASE 12 SHIPPED (branch `fix/foreign-validity-phase12-ambiguous-sense`, 24 pairs,
> 3012→3036 — the whole blocked-vocab class in ONE mechanism).** The "only slot-aware
> disambiguation would move them, and Phase 2 established the slot axis is the wrong
> axis" verdict was HALF-right: the slot axis IS wrong, but the un-probed axis —
> LOCAL TOKEN CONTEXT at the render seam — cleanly separates every one of the 10
> dual-sense words. A full-corpus census (every occurrence of every word, not just
> the failing rows) showed the two senses NEVER share a neighbor shape:
>
> - **Mechanism:** `AMBIGUOUS_SENSES` + `resolveAmbiguousSense` in
>   `expression-lexicon.ts`, consulted by `joinExpressionTokens` AFTER the
>   possessive/of/positional anchors and before the connective table. Five gates:
>   `beforePredicate` (next is a literal or a keyword normalizing to
>   empty/null/undefined/true/false → ar هو / hi है / th เป็น emit `is`),
>   `beforeTypeName` (th เป็น before `Number`/`json`/… emits `as`),
>   `beforeBareIdentifier` (hi नहीं / zh 没有 / tl walang before an ASCII
>   identifier emit `no`; ASCII-word shape required — th lexes `(` as
>   identifier-kind), `afterSubject` (bn আছে / tl may / tr var after a
>   selector/reference emit `exists`), `afterCopula` (ja 空 after a keyword
>   normalizing `is` emits `empty`).
> - **Why the seam and not the tokenizer:** the seam renders TEXT — it can never
>   mint a phantom command (the ja 空 ActionType trap) and never rebinds the word
>   globally (the "mistranslates every other-sense occurrence" blocker). A failed
>   gate leaves the pre-existing render byte-identical.
> - **Measured safety:** before/after render of all 52 corpus rows containing any
>   of the 10 words — exactly the 24 target rows changed, all 28 other-sense rows
>   byte-identical (ar it-sense هو, hi do-not-throw नहीं, th fetch-family เป็น,
>   tl walang_laman compound, the doubled `هو هو "cancel"` resolving `it is`).
> - **Fidelity-neutral by construction:** baseline regen moved only
>   timestamp/commit/bundleSize — R0–R3 never saw this class (expression-value
>   content), which is why only the R4 validity gate ever caught it.
> - Guard tests: `expression-lexicon.test.ts` § "Phase 12" (15 tests; the
>   behavior-body rows are embedded whole — standalone `if` lines parse via a
>   DIFFERENT path that truncates the condition before the seam sees it, a probe
>   footgun to remember).
> - Note for user-authored code: the corpus census is the safety evidence; a
>   user writing hi `है` clause-FINAL (the natural has/is order) or नहीं before an
>   unregistered verb still gets the verbatim leak, not a mistranslation — the
>   gates fail closed.

> **PHASE 11 SHIPPED (7 commits on `fix/foreign-validity-phase11`, 10 pairs,
> 3000→3010).** It cleared EVERY workable pair the Phase-11 triage identified —
> including all four rows this doc filed as blocked/opaque/structural that probing
> re-filed as tractable (the arc's 11th–14th consecutive mis-filings) — plus both
> "unclear, defer by default" probes. What each root cause was, with the corrected
> premise:
>
> - **bn `অথবা`→or + verb-first or-run wait (2: behavior-draggable/sortable bn).**
>   The EXTRAS entry was necessary but NOT sufficient (the arc's recurring shape):
>   `অথবা`/`या` were ALREADY in the parser's OR_KEYWORDS by surface — only the
>   raw-expression seam leaked. Clearing the token exposed blocker #2: bn splits
>   "wait for" as `অপেক্ষা … জন্য` with the floating জন্য in TWO different positions,
>   and the tail anchored a junk `for` command (জন্য→for as a verb). Fix = the
>   verb-FIRST twin of the tr/qu `verbFinalOrRunWait` (`wait-bn-or-run/-2arg`,
>   `patterns/wait.ts`); render keeps only the first event, byte-identical to en.
> - **th `ปรับขนาด`→resize (1: window-resize th).** Filed under "`window` —
>   structural, NOT data"; measured, a plain missing whole-token EXTRAS entry (the
>   greedy Thai scan shattered it into ป + รับ(→take) + ขนาด; NOTE: the Thai
>   tokenizer has NO length cap — the qu cap-bump precedent does not apply). The row
>   now renders byte-identical to en's own render (which also drops the
>   from/debounced tail).
> - **hi when-multiple-changes (1).** TWO leaks (`या`, `बदलने पर`) and a missing
>   pattern. Vocab alone converged to the WRONG render (`on when put …`, valid but
>   divergent): `event-hi-bare` captured the जब token itself as the event. Fix
>   also added `event-hi-when` — the hi member of the ja/tr/ar/he prefix-when
>   family — with the event role TYPE-CONSTRAINED (reference/expression/selector)
>   so the `जब तक` while/until compound (repeat-while, unless-condition) declines
>   at तक. **Register the SPACED `बदलने पर`, never bare `बदलने`** — the stem `बदल`
>   is a registered toggle-verb alternative and the normalizer strips conjugations
>   (the आकार_बदलें phantom-toggle class). en's own render drops `or $lastName
>   changes` (`on $firstName put …`) — that is the convergence target, and hi now
>   matches it byte-identically. Bonus: when-value-changes/hi (en-invalid,
>   gate-excluded) converges to en's own degradation instead of diverging.
> - **bn `এর.error` (1: fetch-error-handling bn).** TWO defects, not the one filed:
>   (a) the conditional's condition-boundary broke AT the glued `.error` (the SOV
>   verb-final command checker saw `.error … রাখুন` as a command head one token
>   early, stranding the member) — new guard: a source-adjacent `.member` never
>   starts a then-branch; (b) the Phase-10 qu branch is connector-gated and bn has
>   no connectors — new connectorless sibling branch in `joinExpressionTokens`,
>   gated on `isAlsoBareReference` (ms `ia`/qu `chay` double as `it` and must keep
>   their valid `it.prop` glue; bn's bare `it` is `এটি`, so `এর` is unambiguous).
> - **window-keydown ar/tl event-duplication (2) — the "risky" structural sub-bug,
>   landed clean.** The fused `if-event-{ar,tl}-vso-verb-first` pattern captures
>   the event, then the `actionValue==='if'` rewind-fold re-parses `all.slice(ifIdx)`
>   which (verb-first only) still contains the on-marker + event → re-swallowed →
>   rendered twice. Fix = excise marker + event + `[filter]` from the fold slice,
>   gated on the pattern id ending `vso-verb-first` and REQUIRING the preceding
>   `on`-marker. **Two probe-found corrections to the plan:** the captured event
>   value carries the `[filter]` while the stream splits it off (compare against
>   the head, `split('[')[0]`), and behavior-removable/sortable (the
>   fidelity-critical fold sharers) are event-FIRST so their slices are
>   byte-identical — probed directly, unchanged.
> - **bn `এ` locative (2: focus-trap/last-in-collection bn) — the "dict realign"
>   filing was wrong; NO dict movement needed.** The failing spans' heads were
>   `শেষ` (registered `end`, but heading positional runs as `last`); the runs
>   failed `matchPositionalRun`'s head check and the locative leaked. Fix =
>   `POSITIONAL_HEAD_DUALS` (bn `শেষ`→last), consulted ONLY inside the run and
>   ONLY before an ANGLE-BRACKET element query. **The narrower gate is
>   load-bearing and was found by probe refuting the fix's own first cut:**
>   behavior-sortable's block-end `শেষ` adjacent to the next clause's bare
>   `.{dragClass}` minted a phantom `last` (`remove last .{dragClass}`, valid but
>   silently wrong) until the element-query gate excluded it.
> - **zh `执行` (1: js-inline zh).** The dict authors the js command as the
>   ASCII+CJK compound `JS执行`; the ASCII extractor claims `JS` (matches the js
>   keyword case-insensitively), stranding `执行` at the head of the opaque js
>   body. Fix = one adjacency-gated check in `consumeJsBlock`: head + next token
>   source-adjacent AND concatenating to the profile's own js-command surface →
>   the tail is part of the VERB. (Do NOT register `执行`→js in EXTRAS — `js` is
>   an ActionType; that mints a phantom `js js`.)
>
> Every commit ran the full loop (semantic suite → populate → both canonical gates →
> allowlist prune with ADDED=0 → fidelity ratchet, all 9 signals green each time).
> Probe scripts were deleted; the committed triage harness
> (`tools/triage-foreign-residual.ts`) was the only scaffolding needed.

> **PHASE 10 SHIPPED (2 commits on `fix/foreign-validity-phase9`, 5 pairs, 2995→3000).
> The residual's own triage was wrong AGAIN — a 10th consecutive mis-filing.** Rebuilding
> the batch harness on the current 64 surfaced two clusters this doc filed as opaque:
>
> - **id `tidak_terdefinisi`→`undefined` (2: behavior-removable/sortable).** Filed under
>   "structural (no leak)"; actually the Phase-9 value-literal shape verbatim — the
>   underscore compound shattered into tidak(→not) + `_ terdefinisi` and rendered the
>   invalid `is not _ terdefinisi`. Whole-token EXTRAS entry; the id extractor's
>   underscore-recovery has NO length cap (unlike qu's), so the entry alone sufficed.
>   The registered sibling `tidakdidefinisikan` never fires — corpus authors the `_` form.
> - **ko `정의안됨`→`undefined` (2: behavior-removable/sortable).** Filed as an opaque
>   "ko 정" single; actually the same shape — 널→null was already registered and renders
>   in the SAME row, only the undefined half was absent. Whole-token EXTRAS entry;
>   4 chars fits the ko longest-first cap (6).
> - **qu `chaypaq.error` condition-seam possessive (1: fetch-error-handling).** The
>   Phase-7 `punya` connector-skip in `joinExpressionTokens` declines a DOT-MEMBER
>   property (`.error` fails `isBareWordHead`), so the connector leaked glued to the
>   member: `if it paq.error` ("Pseudo-commands must be function calls"). The value-slot
>   matcher (`tryMatchPossessiveExpression`) accepts the `.`-selector shape and strips
>   the dot — the put path in the SAME row already rendered `put its error into #error`.
>   Fix: the seam now fires the possessive anchor when a skipped connector is
>   source-adjacent to a dot-member (`its error`), gated on BOTH the connector and
>   adjacency so the no-connector glue path (`it.prop`, valid) and spaced class
>   selectors stay byte-identical. Guard tests in
>   `packages/semantic/test/expression-lexicon.test.ts` (Phase 10 block).
>
> All three: exact-2/exact-1 corpus occurrence verified, phantom-safe. Gates: foreign
> (CLEARED=5, ADDED=0) + en green; fidelity ratchet clean on all 8 signals; semantic
> suite 7366; test:affected green (domain-toolkit 0-test artifact only).
> **HARNESS FOOTGUN (fixed post-Phase-10 by the validity-infra PR): `loadCanonicalParser`'s
> validate used to have TWO failure channels — it RETURNED an error array (empty = valid)
> AND threw on tokenizer-level unknown tokens — so a try/catch-only harness misclassified
> 38/64 pairs as VALID. The contract is now single-channel: validate NEVER throws; the

> from a recipe.**

> **PHASE 9 SHIPPED (1 commit `fix/foreign-validity-phase9`, 4 pairs, 2991→2995). It took
> a path THIS DOC DID NOT LIST — 4 clean value-literal data wins the doc mis-filed as
> "genuinely-blocked ambiguous-vocab" / dismissed as "scatter" (ru/uk `nothing` weren't
> even in the singles table).** The governing lesson, again: the doc's own triage of what
> is "blocked" vs "tractable" was wrong. Register the null/undefined value-literal the
> corpus author used in an `is null`/`is undefined` comparison — it leaked verbatim because
> the tokenizer never bound it:
>
> - ru `ничего`→`null` (behavior-sortable/ru), uk `нічого`→`null` (behavior-sortable/uk) —
>   plain-missing tokenizer EXTRAS entries; sibling `неопределено`/`невизначено`→undefined
>   was already registered, only the null half was absent.
> - qu `mana_riqsisqa`→`undefined` (behavior-removable/qu + behavior-sortable/qu) — the
>   underscore compound, `mana_kanchu`/`hatun_kay` precedent. **The EXTRAS entry alone did
>   NOTHING** (necessary-but-insufficient, like Phase 6): `quechua-keyword.ts`'s longest-first
>   scan caps at `maxKeywordLen = 12`, but `mana_riqsisqa` is 13 chars, so its whole-token
>   entry was never reached and it still shattered at `_` into `mana`(→false)+`_`+`riqsisqa`.
>   Second fix: bump the cap to 13. (`mana_kanchu`=11 fit the cap, which masked the bug.)
>
> Each of the three words occurs in exactly ONE corpus row (verified) and `null`/`undefined`
> are value literals not ActionTypes → phantom-safe.
>
> **CORRECTION to this doc's Phase-9 framing: window-keydown is NOT "lower-risk than swap."**
> Probed its AST: the ar/tl `if-event-<lang>-vso-verb-first` fused pattern has no event-SOURCE
> slot, and when `actionValue==='if'` the parser (`semantic-parser.ts` ~L1741) rewinds to the
> `if` keyword and re-parses `all.slice(ifIdx)` to END — in verb-first order (`if COND
> from-window on EVENT then BODY`) that re-swallows the already-captured `on keydown[..]` event

> behavior-removable/sortable (the fused-if-event fidelity story); a fix risks the fold. Real
> regression risk for 2 pairs. **Both remaining named structural sub-bugs (window-keydown,
> swap) touch fidelity-critical shared paths — neither is a low-risk pick.**

> **PHASE 8 SHIPPED (1 commit on `fix/foreign-validity-phase8`, 2 pairs). It took the
> first of Phase 7's three deferred sub-bugs (modal-close-escape pl/uk) and, true to the
> arc, the handoff's own premise was wrong on the load-bearing detail.**
>
> - **modal-close-escape pl/uk (2 pairs).** Source `... ukryj .modal z okno ...` /
>   `... сховати .modal з вікно ...` = "hide .modal **from window**" rendered the invalid
>   `hide .modal with window`. Root cause: the handcrafted `hide-pl-full` / `hide-uk-full`
>   patterns (`packages/semantic/src/patterns/hide.ts`) carry an optional `z {style}` /
>   `з {style}` group whose `style` role token **omits the schema's `expectedTypes:
>   ['literal']`**. Polish `z` and Ukrainian `з` mean BOTH "with" (instrumental style) AND
>   "from" (ablative source), so `z okno` matched the style marker; with no type guard the
>   reference `window` (a reference since Phase 5) bound the literal-only style slot. Adding
>   `expectedTypes: ['literal']` to the two style tokens makes the reference fail the type
>   check → the optional group backtracks → `z okno` is left unconsumed and **dropped**,
>   which is exactly what es/de/en already do (en's `from window` is an event source the
>   parser discards by design; es/de leave `de ventana`/`von fenster` unconsumed because
>   their "from" word ≠ their "with" marker). Render becomes `hide .modal` — valid.
> - **The handoff's caveat was FALSE.** It said "`isTypeCompatible('reference',['literal'])`
>   is already false, so `okno` binds as a literal/identifier, not a reference — check the
>   captured type." Measured: `okno` binds as a **reference** (`{type:'reference',
>   value:'window'}`), and the type check never fired **because the handcrafted style token
>   had no `expectedTypes` at all** — the guard is present in the matcher (pattern-matcher.ts
>   line ~892) but skipped when the token declares no types. So the fix was not "override the
>   schema guard" but "give the token the constraint the schema already declares."
> - **PROBE FOOTGUN that hid this for a while: `node.roles` is a `Map`, and
>   `JSON.stringify(node)` renders a Map as `{}`.** A naive node dump shows every command with
>   `"roles": {}` and looks like the values live elsewhere; they don't. Deserialize Maps
>   (walk with `x instanceof Map`) before trusting a role dump — otherwise you cannot see the
>   captured `style: reference window` that IS the bug.
> - **it/ru/vi have the SAME latent gap** (their `hide-*-full` style tokens also omit
>   `expectedTypes`) but do not manifest: Italian `con`, Russian `с`, Vietnamese `với` are
>   "with" only; their corpora say "from window" with a different word (ru `из`), so the
>   style group never matches. Left untouched (no failing pair, no collision). If a future
>   corpus row collides there, apply the same one-line constraint.

> **PHASE 7 SHIPPED (3 commits on `fix/foreign-validity-phase7`, 10 pairs).** It
> refuted this doc's own "no shared root cause / accept 97.4 % as the practical
> ceiling" verdict — a batch triage harness (render+validate SEPARATELY, then cluster
> by the true leaked token/complaint) surfaced shared clusters the per-row prose triage
> hid. The efficient loop that found them: build the harness once, cluster, fix the
> largest true cluster, re-run the harness for an instant all-pairs delta, then gate.
>
> - **id `punya` possessive (4 pairs: computed-value/if-empty/input-validation/
>   two-way-binding).** `saya punya nilai` = "my value" rendered `my punya nilai` in
>   every `if`/`+`/paren expression: the value-slot matcher skips the
>   `possessive.connectors` word, but `joinExpressionTokens` (the raw-expression seam)
>   did not. Taught it to skip the connector. No-connector path byte-identical.
> - **focus-trap ar/tl (2 pairs).** KEY REFRAME: the parser drops a handler's
>   `from <source>` phrase BY DESIGN — en `on keydown[..] from .modal if …` itself
>   renders `on keydown[..] if …`. The foreign rows only differed by LEAKING the
>   untranslated source token (`source .modal` / `من window`). Excise the
>   `<source-marker> <value>` clause when it sits before the `<on-marker> <event>` head
>   and re-parse. Gated to CONDITION-LED heads (`arr[0]` → `if`) so a COMMAND source
>   (tl `alisin .active mula_sa .items kapag click`) is never touched — the looser
>   first cut regressed exactly those 4 tests.
> - **swap bn/hi/tr/qu (4 pairs).** `swap #a with #b`: the SOV patient-first pattern
>   binds the trailing element (#b) to `destination`, but its group only carried the
>   locative dest-marker — the corpus marks #b with the WITH-word (`#b से`/`#b দিয়ে`),

## What Phase 11 left — NOTHING structural: Phase 11b shipped swap ar/tl (2 pairs, 3010→3012)

Window-keydown was one Phase-8 deferral; Phase 11 landed it clean (see the PHASE 11
block above). **Phase 11b (branch `fix/foreign-validity-phase11b-swap`) landed the
other — swap ar/tl — as its own PR because it regenerates the fidelity baseline.**
Three coordinated changes, two probe-found corrections to the plan:

- **ar proclitic glue** (`arabic-proclitic.ts`): the single-char path's
  `remainingLength < 2` guard rejected `بـ#b` (the tatweel counts 1, and it IS
  `isArabic` — U+0640 sits in the base block). New exception: preposition proclitic +
  tatweel-ONLY run + next char `#`/`.` → emit `بـ`→with consuming proclitic+tatweel.
  ASCII attachments (`بـmethod:"POST"`) and `*`-sigil style refs (`بـ*opacity`,
  show/hide-with-transition — valid today) keep the decline path byte-identical
  (all 10 `بـ` corpus rows probed; the one other INVALID, fetch-formdata ar `كـ`,
  is pre-existing and outside the gate denominator).
- **swap-gated trailing group** in `generateVSOVerbFirstEventHandlerPattern`
  (`event-handlers-vso.ts`): optional post-event `<with-word> {destination}` group.
  **Plan correction: do NOT rebind patient→destination** — the Phase 7 SOV precedent
  binds the trailing element to `destination` (operand flip vs en = the documented
  F6 wontfix, swap being runtime-symmetric), and mirroring it exactly is what keeps
  the render consistent with the SOV languages (`swap #b with #a`, valid).
- **schema data**: ar `بـ` (exactly as the extractor now emits it) + tl `nang` in
  swap's patient markerOverride (`command-schemas.ts`).

**The `--save-baseline` regen locked in swap-content 0.714→1.0 confidence for SIX
languages** — ar/tl from this fix plus bn/hi/qu/tr, whose Phase-7 SOV improvements
were never baselined (the ratchet only flags drops, so improvements silently
accumulate until the next deliberate regen; per-language avgRoleFidelity rose too).

> **PHASE 6 SHIPPED — and, true to this doc's own governing lesson, BOTH its fix-site
> claims were incomplete; a probe caught each.**
>
> - **`as` connective (zh + hi), 2 pairs.** The reverse `CONNECTIVE_LEXICON` entries always
>   existed; the tokenizer shattered the compound before lookup. zh `作为` cleared with a
>   whole-token `CHINESE_EXTRAS` entry (longest-first beats the 1-char `为`→`for`). **hi
>   `के_रूप_में` did NOT clear from the EXTRAS entry alone** — the handoff's "only the
>   registration is missing" was wrong. `के` is a possessive PARTICLE, so
>   `HindiParticleExtractor` (registered ahead of `HindiKeywordExtractor`) peeled `के` off
>   before the underscore-recovery could see the whole run. The `आकार_बदलें` precedent works
>   only because its head `आकार` is not a particle. Fix = teach `HindiParticleExtractor` to
>   DECLINE when the run is an underscore-joined REGISTERED keyword
>   (`hindi-particle.ts` `underscoreJoinedKeyword`), so the keyword extractor claims it.
> - **`beep!` possessive glue+leak (bn/hi/ja/ko/tr), 5 pairs.** The handoff said "start from
>   `joinExpressionTokens`'s possessive anchor" — the anchor is INNOCENT and was never
>   called. The value took the SOV verb-anchoring fallback, whose `tokensToSemanticValue`
>   empty-string-glued the tokens AND skipped translation. Fix = route only the multi-token
>   fall-through through `joinExpressionTokens` (`semantic-parser.ts`). But that surfaced a
>   SECOND defect the handoff missed entirely: `beep!` tokenizes as `beep` + `!`, and the
>   canonical parser REJECTS the spaced `beep !` ("Unexpected Token : !"). So the join had to
>   GAIN a rule, not just preserve spaces — a source-adjacent leading `!` now glues like the
>   `.`-member rule (`expression-lexicon.ts`). **en is separately, pre-existingly broken**
>   (`set $x to beep! my value` → `set $x to beep`; `matchRoleToken` single-token capture
>   drops the tail) — DEFERRED, out of the foreign gate's scope. See § "What Phase 6 shipped".

> **PHASE 5 SHIPPED — and it disproved this doc's OWN Phase-5 diagnosis, which is why the
> two correction blocks that used to sit here are deleted, not preserved.** Every claim the
> deleted blocks made was measured false against the authored corpus:
>
> - **The fix site was NOT `matchRoleToken` / "role capture."** The doc's marquee claim —
>   "`repeat`'s `source` role captures the raw surface while `put`'s `destination` captures
>   the normalized English, in the same tree" — is a confound. Holding the role constant,
>   `repeat.source` renders `ボディ`→`body` perfectly. The comparison varied *registration*,
>   not *role*. The role is innocent; `matchRoleToken` was untouched.
> - **The real cause was one seven-name Set.** `DEFAULT_REFERENCES`
>   (`packages/intent/src/ir/references.ts`) knew `me/you/it/result/event/target/body` and
>   nothing else. A foreign `document` surface lexed as a keyword, failed `isValidReference`,
>   degraded to a `literal`, was rejected by the slot's `expectedTypes`, and leaked. `body`
>   round-trips because it is in that Set AND every profile; `document` was in neither. Fix =
>   widen the Set + the `ReferenceValue` union + add the surface to 20 profiles. **Zero logic
>   change.** (The "spiked and reverted, data alone insufficient" verdict was also a
>   confound: the spike registered the profile surface but never widened the Set.)
> - **It was 7 validity pairs, not 17; `window` was 0; `detail` was preventive.** The "17"
>   counted rows where `document` *appears*; most had unrelated blockers. `window`'s three
>   rows are structural (role misattachment / `من` leak / no-dict mangling), not data —
>   identical fail-set with and without it. `detail` never occurs as a bare reference in the
>   corpus (only `event.detail.message`), so it cleared nothing; it was registered for drift
>   reconciliation (it is already in core's `REFERENCE_KEYWORDS`).
> - **The real prize was invisible to the gate.** 58 corpus rows changed their render; only

MISSION: post-Phase-12 state of the foreign→English validity burndown. Authored
non-English LokaScript renders canonically-valid English **3036/3059 (≈99.2 %)**;
**23 pairs across 1 pattern** (pick-text-range) remain. Phases 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 11, 11b, and 12 are DONE. **The blocked-vocab class was cleared by Phase 12's
ambiguous-sense anchor (see the PHASE 12 block above)** — the arc is at its
practical ceiling short of the pick-text-range ~3-arc effort. **The residual is fully
triaged AND fully classified** — the post-Phase-11 harness clustering is exactly:
pick-text-range 23 (17 SVO `Unexpected value: <<<EOF>>>` + 5 SOV `Unexpected Token : 0` +
qu 1); the blocked-vocab throw families (th `เป็น` 6, ar `هو` copula 5, hi `है` 5,
ja `空` 2, hi `नहीं` 1, tl `walang` 1, zh `没` 1, bn `আছে` 1, tl `may` 1, tr `var` 1 —
24 total). Swap ar/tl shipped as Phase 11b (§ "What Phase 11 left"). (The
ground-truth counts in `baselines/foreign-canonical-validity.json` —
`validAtGeneration`/`checkedAtGeneration` — are authoritative, not the prose percentage.)
For the first time in the arc there is NO mis-filed-tractable tail left to probe out:
Phase 11 drained it (its four re-filings — th resize "structural", bn `এ` "dict realign",
zh `执行` "opaque", bn `অথবা` "?" — were the 11th–14th consecutive mis-filings). The
realistic Phase 12 menu: (a) swap ar/tl in its own PR (design in § "What Phase 11 left"),
(b) the pick-text-range family (~3 arcs, spike verdict below), ~~(c) the remaining infra
follow-up (bake the parse-check into the `@hyperscript-tools/i18n` transpiler)~~ —
**DONE for the English side** (`src/validate.ts`, CLI `--check`, Eleventy `parseCheck`;
foreign-output gating still awaits the v2 semantic transpiler), or
(d) slot-aware disambiguation research for the blocked copula/exists families — the only
thing that would move the 24 blocked pairs, and genuinely hard.

**The vocabulary, expression, and structural slices are ALL exhausted as of Phase 11b.**
What remains is exactly two classes: the **24 deliberately-blocked
ambiguous-vocab exclusions** (th `เป็น`=is/as, ar `هو`=it/is, hi `है`=is/has,
ja `空` phantom, hi `नहीं`/zh `没`/tl `walang` no-not-without, bn `আছে`/tl `may`/
tr `var` exists-has — genuinely hard, honest calls; only slot-aware disambiguation
would move them, and Phase 2 established the slot axis is the wrong axis), and the
**23-pair `pick-text-range`** family (spike verdict below: ~3 arcs, not one PR).
**`form-submit-prevent` ar was mis-diagnosed by earlier handoffs as mechanical — it is
the ar `هو`→`it` copula exclusion (renders `if result it false`). Phase 11's planning
probe also REFUTED the "registration ORDER makes ar `is` structurally impossible"
claim: EXTRAS run LAST and override profile entries (`base-tokenizer.ts` ~L553), so
order is no barrier — but the pair stays blocked on the genuine it/is ambiguity
(`إذا هو هو "cancel"` = "if it is cancel" — both senses adjacent on one line).**
Of the two infra follow-ups, R4 is DONE (#727); the second — baking the parse-check
into the `@hyperscript-tools/i18n` transpiler (roadmap §5) — is DONE for the ENGLISH
side (`packages/hyperscript-tools-i18n/src/validate.ts` reuses the `loadCanonicalParser`
recipe; CLI `--check` exits 3, Eleventy `parseCheck: 'off'|'warn'|'error'`, `./validate`
API). Faithful foreign-OUTPUT gating there still awaits the v2 semantic transpiler (the
i18n GrammarTransformer's `toEnglish` is the known-weak 8/30 round-trip path).

**Phase 5 registered `document`/`window`/`detail` in one shared Set + 20 profiles — DO NOT
re-plan it.** It is drift reconciliation (core's `REFERENCE_KEYWORDS` and the parser's
`PROPERTY_ACCESS_BASES` already listed all three; only `DEFAULT_REFERENCES` and the semantic
`ReferenceValue` union lagged). Cleared 7 pairs and 51 gate-invisible silent corrections.
Named follow-ups it left, all preserved below: (a) three more desynced reference lists
(`semantic-parser.ts:4149` live; two `isBuiltInReference` copies test-only); (b) the
`window's scrollY` lossy-possessive round-trip; (c) `detail` bare-reference has no corpus
row yet.

**THE ARC'S GOVERNING LESSON, which this doc has itself violated four times: PROBE THE
CLAIM BEFORE YOU PLAN AROUND IT — AND PROBE THE FIX'S PREMISE.** Every phase found a
load-bearing falsehood in its own handoff — a "case-sensitive" lookup that lowercases, a
cautionary example that does not reproduce, three "dead on arrival" languages that all
worked, a defect count 5× too high, a 17-pair family that was 7, and a marquee "role
capture" fix-site that a single same-slot probe (`ボディ`→`body`) refutes. Each was one probe
away from being caught. **Including the claims in this paragraph.**

READ FIRST (in order):

1. § "What is left" below — the triage. It supersedes every earlier prose estimate.
2. `packages/testing-framework/baselines/foreign-canonical-validity.json` — the
   committed allowlist (68 pairs / ~17 patterns after Phase 8). It ratchets BOTH ways: a
   pair you clear must be pruned, or the gate fails on a stale entry.
3. `docs-internal/EXPRESSION_INTERNAL_TRANSLATION_SCOPE.md` — the spec, § "Where the
   burndown stands".
4. `packages/semantic/src/parser/utils/expression-lexicon.ts` — the shared expression
   seam. Phase 4 closed its last call-site gap; **it is unlikely you need to touch it.**

## What Phase 2 established (do not re-derive)

- **The fix was profile DATA, not a new mechanism.** `surfaceOf`
  (`expression-lexicon.ts:371-372`) emits a token's `normalized` English form **iff it
  lexed as a keyword**; anything else leaks verbatim. So the whole copula/operator gap
  was *missing `profile.keywords` entries*. No slot parameter, no `COPULA_LEXICON`, no
  renderer change. Three PRs, zero logic changes (bar one dead-code removal), 70 pairs:
  `matches` ×13 profiles → 15 pairs, `exists` ×13 → 13, `is` ×10 → 42.
- **A slot parameter would not have worked anyway.** `es` is Spanish `is`
  (`spanish.ts`) but German `it` (`german.ts`). That is a *language* axis, not a slot
  axis; the profile is already the per-language axis.
- **`is`/`exists`/`matches`/`no` are phantom-SAFE**, unlike `empty`. `empty` is both an
  ActionType (`types.ts`) and a command schema (`command-schemas.ts`) — that is why ja
  `空` injected a phantom command (`japanese.ts:108-111`). The operators are neither, so
  no pattern is generated from them. Verify for any new word; don't assume.
- **`CONDITION_COPULAS_SURFACE` (`semantic-parser.ts`) is down to 3 entries** (ar هو /
  th เป็น / hi है) — exactly the three the copula slice could not register, because each
  is ambiguous with another sense. It is no longer a general mechanism.
- **Deliberate exclusions, each ambiguous with another sense** (all cost real pairs; all
  are the honest call): ar هو=`it`, hi है=`has/have`, th เป็น=`as` (copula); bn আছে=`has`,
  tl `may`/tr `var`=`has/have` (exists). ar is *structurally* impossible regardless:
  `profile.references` is registered AFTER `keywords` (`base-tokenizer.ts`), so an ar
  `is` entry is silently overwritten.
- ja `である` does **NOT** split, contrary to an earlier claim. It is registered and clears.
- **The ratchet's tolerances can hide a small regression.** `avgFidelity` tolerance 0.02
  averaged over ~133 patterns cannot see one pattern dropping to fid 0.75 (0.25/133 ≈
  0.002), and the lossy-flip counter has tolerance 3. When a change has a *named*
  single-pattern hazard, probe that pattern directly. (Phase 2 did: the copula slice
  removed ja/bn's escape from the ko-class "guard swallows the then-branch verb" bug.)

## What Phase 4 shipped (three PRs, 30 pairs, 124 → 94)

All three are DONE. Recorded here because each corrected something this doc asserted —
**the doc's own claims were the least reliable input to the arc.** Every correction below
was verified against the AUTHORED corpus rows, not reasoned from the code.

**1. `no` — `behavior-draggable` 20 → 9 (11 pairs).** Pure profile data, Phase 2's shape.
Registered in 16 languages.

- **The "dead on arrival" call was wrong for all three.** id `tidak_ada` and qu
  `mana_kanchu` clear via a whole-token tokenizer EXTRAS entry (the `ubah_ukuran` /
  `hatun_kay` precedent — the keyword walk sorts longest-first, so the compound beats the
  `_` split); ar `لا يوجد` clears via the base tokenizer's multi-word keyword walk (the hi
  `मेل खाता` precedent). **id and qu cleared the gate outright.** The lesson: "the
  tokenizer splits it" is not a reason to give up — check for a whole-token precedent.
- **The ja `ない` hazard is real in principle but does not fire.** `ない` has blast radius 3
  and the dict's `not` (`ではない`) is unregistered, so the particle extractor peels で/は and
  can land on a bare `ない`. Probed: `unless-condition` (protected by `ない限り`, longest-first)
  and `fetch-do-not-throw` both render byte-identically before and after.
- **bn is not lexical.** Its dict has no `no`, so its row already carries literal English
  `no` and renders it correctly; it fails structurally. The ceiling was 19, not 20.
- The hi/zh/tl exclusions stand, but the reason is **dict-level**, not a profile
  collision: those profiles never register the surface — the DICT maps two senses to one
  (`hi not:'नहीं'` AND `no:'नहीं'`), so registering it as `no` would mistranslate every
  `not`/`without` in those corpora. es `not:'no'` was a non-issue as written.

**2. `references` drift — `modal-close-backdrop` 2 → 0, `focus-trap` ja (3 pairs).** Three
tokenizer EXTRAS lines + `matches` for ar/ja. **Both reasons this doc gave for deferring it
as a CODE change are FALSE:**

- **The lookup is NOT case-sensitive.** `lookupKeyword`/`isKeyword` both `.toLowerCase()`
  (`packages/framework/src/core/tokenization/base-tokenizer.ts` — note this doc pointed at
  a path that does not exist; `packages/semantic/src/parser/base-tokenizer.ts` is a
  re-export). The cited `:633-634` is a COMMENT inside `tryMultiWordKeyword`, which only
  handles space-containing keywords and which German never reaches. **The whole de
  sub-family was a non-issue** — de renders `body`/`target` correctly today.
- **No type change was needed.** The per-language `*_EXTRAS` array already supports
  alternates and overrides profile entries (precedent: `japanese.ts` `私`→me).
- **The stated cautionary example does not exist.** de/fr/pt `if-exists` do NOT "clear
  while still leaking `körper`/`ça`/`isso`" — probed against the authored rows, all three
  render byte-identically to en (`körper` via the case-insensitive lookup, `ça`/`isso` via
  existing EXTRAS).
- Of the 16 "drifted" entries only **3 actually leak** (ar `نتيجة`/`هدف`, ja `対象`); the
  rest are absorbed by the case-insensitive lookup, EXTRAS, `possessive.keywords`, or a
  profile keyword. 16 was right as a text-diff and ~5× too high as a defect count.

**The operand+operator coupling was REAL, and is the arc's one durable lesson.** The
condition is captured as a raw string; ar/ja's *unparsed* condition was silently dropped,
so `hide` ran unconditionally and coincidentally matched the en DOM effect —
`modal-close-backdrop` ar/ja passed R2 **by accident**. `matches` alone would parse the
condition into a real comparison whose operand evaluates to undefined, stopping `hide` and
flipping R2 pass→fail at tolerance 0. Both together render byte-identical to en. Only R2
can see this class.

**3. Condition locative — `focus-trap` 19 → 3 (16 pairs, incl. a `last-in-collection tr`
bonus).** The diagnosis in this doc was RIGHT; two details were not.

- **`surfaceOf` has THREE failure modes, not two:** verbatim leak, role-name leak, and
  wrong-sense-normalized leak (bn `শেষ`→`end`, out of scope — a dict realign).
- **The prescription omitted anchor ORDER, which is load-bearing.** The new anchor must sit
  AFTER the of-possessive anchor so it can only claim runs the earlier anchors declined
  (provably additive). Positional-first would flip `<positional> <sel> <of-marker> <sel>`
  away from `<sel> of <sel>`, and for a marker absent from `LOCATIVE_SURFACES` (zh `的`,
  ja `の`) `toEnglishLocative` falls through to the VERBATIM surface — worse than the leak.
- No data was added: `toEnglishLocative` / `LOCATIVE_SURFACES` /
  `ROLE_CONCEPT_TO_ENGLISH_LOCATIVE` already covered both classes. It was purely a
  call-site gap. `matchPositionalRun` now serves both seams.
- The run returns `{text, token}` pairs, not strings: the two callers join differently
  (role seam = plain space; the raw join needs SOURCE POSITION for `.`-glue). Bare strings
  would silently render `previous <input/> .value` inside conditions.

## What is left (**23 pairs after Phase 12**) — MEASURED, not estimated

> **Phase 12 cleared every non-pick row below.** The table is preserved as the
> pre-Phase-12 record; the current residual is exactly `pick-text-range` × 23
> (all languages but en). Reproduce with the committed triage harness.

### Pre-Phase-12 snapshot (historical)

Produced by the committed triage harness against the post-Phase-11 tree (fresh populate).
**Reproduce it before trusting it** (recipe at the end of this section). Phase 11 removed
every row of the old table that was not pick-text-range or genuinely-blocked vocab:
bn `অথবা` (2 — plus the wait or-run structural half), bn `এ` locative (2 — via the শেষ
positional-head dual, NO dict realign), th `ป`/window-resize (1), hi `बदलने`+`या` (1),
bn `এর` (1), zh `执行` (1), window-keydown ar/tl (2). The table below is the CURRENT
snapshot, complete and classified — there is no "structural (no leak)" bucket left and no
unexplained singles.

| # | Family | Kind | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 23 | `pick-text-range` | deferred, ~3 arcs | all but en (17 SVO EOF + 5 SOV `0` + qu) |
| 6 | th `เป็น` (=is/as) | blocked | `behavior-removable`, `behavior-sortable`, `form-submit-prevent`, `if-empty`, `input-validation`, `computed-value` |
| 5 | ar `هو` (=it/is copula) | blocked | `behavior-removable`, `behavior-sortable`, `form-submit-prevent`, `if-empty`, `input-validation` |
| 5 | hi `है` (=is/has) | blocked | same five patterns |
| 2 | ja `空` (=empty) | phantom-blocked | `if-empty`, `input-validation` |
| 1 | hi `नहीं` (=no/not) | blocked | `behavior-draggable` |
| 1 | tl `walang` (=no/without) | blocked (+degraded) | `behavior-draggable` |
| 1 | zh `没` (=no/without) | blocked | `behavior-draggable` |
| 1 | bn `আছে` (=exists/has) | blocked | `if-exists` |
| 1 | tl `may` (=exists/has) | blocked | `if-exists` |
| 1 | tr `var` (=exists/has) | blocked | `if-exists` |

### 1. DONE (Phase 5) — `document`/`window`/`detail` context globals — 7 pairs, pure data

**Shipped. Left here so no future session re-spikes the wrong fix.** Cleared 7 validity pairs
(`behavior-draggable` ar/ja/ko/ru/uk, `behavior-sortable` ja/zh) plus **51 gate-invisible
silent corrections** (es `from documento` → `from document`, etc.). Validity 96.9 % → 97.2 %.

**The fix, in full:** widen `DEFAULT_REFERENCES` (`packages/intent/src/ir/references.ts`) with
`document`/`window`/`detail`; extend the `ReferenceValue` union (`packages/semantic/src/types.ts`);
add the three surfaces to `references` in the 20 profiles whose dict carries them (skip
bn/he/th/vi — no dict entry; they author literal English `document` and already round-trip).
Update the count assertion in `packages/framework/src/ir/references.test.ts` (7 → 10). Guard:
`packages/semantic/test/context-globals-references.test.ts`. **Zero logic change.**

**Named follow-ups (do NOT fold into a `beep!`/`as` PR):** three more desynced reference
lists — `semantic-parser.ts:4149` (LIVE if-chain), and two `isBuiltInReference` copies
(`packages/semantic/src/parser/utils/type-validation.ts:142`,
`packages/framework/src/core/pattern-matching/utils/type-validation.ts:132`, test-only) —
none on the fix's path, but they should route through `isValidReference` so the next widening
can't desync; the five parallel `protocol/` lists (ts/py/rust + ABNF, out of the workspace,
nothing breaks but the sense now differs); and the `window's scrollY` lossy-possessive
round-trip (`set x to body's scrollTop` → `set x to body` — pre-existing for `body`, now
extended to window/document; no corpus row exercises it, `window-scroll` keeps it in an `if`
condition, verified VALID). `detail` has no bare-reference corpus row — its registration is
preventive drift-reconciliation only.

### 2. DONE (Phase 6) — The `as` connective — zh + hi cleared (2 pairs); th deferred

**Shipped.** zh `作为` (rendered `作 for Number`) and hi `के_रूप_में` (rendered
`के _ रूप _ में`) now render `as Number`. The reverse `CONNECTIVE_LEXICON` entries already
existed; the tokenizer shattered the compound before lookup.

- **zh** — whole-token `CHINESE_EXTRAS` entry `{作为→as}`; longest-first beats the 1-char
  `为`→`for`. Pure data, as expected.
- **hi** — the EXTRAS entry `{के_रूप_में→as}` was **necessary but NOT sufficient** (the
  "`ubah_ukuran`/`mana_kanchu` precedent is the fix" claim was wrong). `के` is a possessive
  PARTICLE, so `HindiParticleExtractor` (registered ahead of `HindiKeywordExtractor`) peeled
  it off before the underscore-recovery ran. `आकार_बदलें` works only because `आकार` is not a
  particle. Second fix: `HindiParticleExtractor.underscoreJoinedKeyword` declines when the
  run is an underscore-joined REGISTERED keyword, ceding it to the keyword extractor.
- **th `เป็น` — still deferred.** BOTH `as` and copula `is`; a blanket entry rewrites every
  Thai `is`. `computed-value` th remains allowlisted (1 pair). Would need slot-sensitive
  disambiguation (resolve to `as` only before a type name) — NOT attempted.
- **`computed-value` id is unrelated** — it renders `as Number` fine; it fails on the
  possessive tail `my punya nilai` (structural, § 5), so it stays allowlisted.

### 3. DONE (Phase 6) — `beep!` possessive glue+leak — all 5 cleared

**Shipped.** `beep-debug-expression` bn/hi/ja/ko/tr now render the canonical `beep! my value`.
The handoff's premise was doubly wrong:

- **`joinExpressionTokens`'s possessive anchor is INNOCENT and was never called** for this
  value. The `beep!`-headed run fails every generated `set` pattern, so the clause takes the
  SOV verb-anchoring fallback, whose `tokensToSemanticValue` empty-string-glued the tokens
  (`beep!私の値`) AND skipped translation. Fix = route only the multi-token fall-through
  through `joinExpressionTokens` (`semantic-parser.ts`); the possessive anchor then fires.
- **A second defect the handoff missed:** `beep!` tokenizes as `beep` + `!`, and the
  canonical parser REJECTS the spaced `beep !` ("Unexpected Token : !"). So the join had to
  GAIN a rule — a source-adjacent leading `!` glues like the `.`-member rule
  (`expression-lexicon.ts`). "The join loses its spaces" was only half the story; it also had
  to STOP adding one.
- ~~**en is separately, pre-existingly broken and DEFERRED.**~~ **DONE (2026-07-19,
  the beep!-prefix value fold).** The probe showed the deferral note undersold it:
  **18 of 24 languages truncated** (`set $x to beep`), not just en — every SVO/VSO
  language shared en's single-token capture, gate-invisibly (the truncated render is
  valid English, and the en REFERENCE truncated identically so no recall signal
  moved). Fix = `tryMatchBeepPrefixExpression` in `pattern-matcher.ts`, the prefix
  sibling of the operator-run fold: `beep` + SOURCE-ADJACENT `!` + operand →
  one expression value joined through `joinExpressionTokens` (which supplies the
  Phase-6 `!`-glue). All 24 languages now render the full `beep! my value`;
  R1 rose in 15 languages (7 to 1.0000) — the truncating reference had been
  masking a role-fidelity gap. Guards in `beep-debug-expression.test.ts`; the R1
  Family-D locks updated to the better type (patient:expression, mirror intact).

### 4. ~~Deliberately blocked (24 after Phase 11)~~ — CLEARED (Phase 12, ambiguous-sense anchor)

**The class no longer exists.** Every rationale below was correct about REGISTRATION
(a blanket tokenizer/profile binding does mistranslate the other sense / phantom a
command) — the render-seam anchor avoids registration entirely. Preserved for the
record:

- hi `है` (5), th `เป็น` (6), and ar `هو` (5) are the copula slice's **named ambiguous
  exclusions** (`है`=is/has, `เป็น`=is/as, `هو`=it/is). Registering any of them
  mistranslates every other-sense occurrence in those corpora (ar's
  `إذا هو هو "cancel"` has both senses ADJACENT). Only a slot-aware disambiguation
  helps, and Phase 2 established the slot axis is the WRONG axis (`es` is Spanish `is`
  but German `it`). **Phase 11 refuted the ar registration-order framing** (EXTRAS
  override everything, `base-tokenizer.ts` ~L553) — the block is pure ambiguity.
- The no/not/without family — hi `नहीं`, zh `没(有)`, tl `walang` (1 each,
  behavior-draggable) — and the exists/has family — bn `আছে`, tl `may`, tr `var`
  (1 each, if-exists) — are the Phase-4/2 dict-level dual-sense exclusions. Same
  verdict: registering one sense mistranslates the other.
- ja `空` (2) is the **phantom-injection word** (`japanese.ts`): `empty` is both an
  ActionType and a command schema, so registering `空` injects a phantom command. This is
  the one place the "register the surface" reflex is actively wrong. (Same trap, other
  shape: zh `执行`→`js` would phantom a `js js` — Phase 11 fixed that row in the
  js-block consumer instead.)

### 5. ~~Structural, no leak~~ — DRAINED (Phases 7–11)

The old per-row bucket is empty. Phase 7 cleared focus-trap ar/tl, swap bn/hi/tr/qu, and
id `punya`; Phase 8 cleared modal-close-escape pl/uk; Phases 9–10 cleared the qu/ru/uk/id/ko
value-literals and the qu dot-member; Phase 11 cleared everything else (see its block at the
top). Phase 11b drained the last structural row (swap ar/tl) — § "What Phase 11 left".

### Reproduce the triage

**The harness is now COMMITTED — do not rebuild it from a recipe:**

```bash
npm run populate --prefix packages/patterns-reference   # fresh DB first
npx tsx packages/testing-framework/tools/triage-foreign-residual.ts [--detail out.json]
```

It renders and validates every allowlisted pair SEPARATELY and clusters by the
canonical parser's actual complaint (~2 s, no gate). `--detail` dumps
source/rendered/errors per pair. Since the validity-infra PR, `validate` never
throws (tokenizer-level `Unknown token` throws fold into the returned error array
as `threw: …` entries) and the gate reports the render WITH the failure instead
of discarding it as `(threw)`.

Grep the render for non-ASCII to find the leak — in a 20-line behavior body the bad token
is one word on one line, and the parser only reports a single CHARACTER.

## SPIKE VERDICT: `pick-text-range` — keep deferred, and the docs' reason was wrong

The old framing ("a named R1 deferral: pick range-role modeling", "one en-side fix
clears 23 foreign + 1 en") is **wrong on both counts**. It is not one fix, and it is not
range-roles. It is four coupled efforts:

1. **The schema models the wrong command.** `pickSchema` (`command-schemas.ts:2598`) is
   *"Select a random element from a collection"* with roles patient/source
   (`pick <item1>, <item2>` / `pick from <array>`). Canonical hyperscript's `pick`
   (`hyperscript.org@0.9.93`, `dist/_hyperscript.js:5979-6090`) is a different command
   with **6 variants** (`first`/`last`/`random`/`item(s)`/`character(s)`/`match(es)`),
   each with its own arg shape, plus a range sub-grammar
   `[at|from] (start|<expr>) [to (end|<expr>)] [inclusive|exclusive]`.
2. **The vocabulary does not exist in ANY language.** No dict defines `characters`,
   `items`, `random`, `start`, `end`, `inclusive`, or `exclusive`. The corpus proves it:
   all 23 translations leave `characters` in **literal English**.
3. **The corpus rows are themselves broken.** The range `to` was translated as a
   DESTINATION marker (es `0 a 5`, it `0 in 5`, vi `0 vào 5`, th `0 ใน 5`, ru `0 в 5`),
   and the SOV rows are scrambled (ja `characters 0 を クリック で 選択 5 の #note に`,
   qu, tr, bn, hi, ko). Re-authoring them couples to the fidelity baseline
   (memory: `corpus-rewrites-couple-to-fidelity`).
4. **R1 would move** — the roles change shape.

So the en fix alone clears **1** pair (the en allowlist entry), not 24; the 23 foreign
pairs additionally need (2) and (3). Budget it as ~3 arcs, not one PR. It remains the
sole entry in `baselines/canonical-validity.json`.

## Also true (verified, corrects the record)

- The residual is **20 patterns / 87 pairs** after Phase 5 (`document` cleared 7 across
  `behavior-draggable`/`behavior-sortable`, but neither pattern left the allowlist — both
  keep other-language failures). It was 20 patterns / 94 pairs after Phase 4, 21 before, and
  never the 19 the pre-Phase-2 handoff and the scope doc both claimed.
- The sibling **en-render burndown is DONE** — `canonical-validity.json` holds exactly
  **1** entry (`pick-text-range`), not the 22 that `HANDOFF_render-validity-burndown.md`
  described. That doc is deleted; its two still-live follow-ups are preserved below.
- `repeat-until-event` fr/it/zh/pl is **NOT** a real family — it was stale-dist/stale-DB
  noise. A freshly populated DB reproduces the committed baseline exactly.
- `marker-templates.ts` is dead code (zero importers) despite `semantic/CLAUDE.md`.
- **This doc has been the arc's least reliable input.** Phase 4 found a false premise in
  every family it touched (a "case-sensitive" lookup that lowercases; a cautionary example
  that does not reproduce; three "dead on arrival" languages that all work; a defect count
  ~5× too high). All were cheap to disprove with one probe against the authored corpus.
  **Probe the claim before you plan around it** — including the claims above.

## Preserved follow-ups (from the now-deleted render-validity handoff)

- ~~**Fold validity in as an R4 signal** on the ratchet CLI (`--regression`)~~ — **DONE**
  (validity-infra PR): the CLI's `--regression` now runs the foreign validity check
  against the committed allowlist as the R4 ratchet (new invalid pair OR stale
  allowlist entry both fail; full mode only). The en-side check remains vitest-only
  (its allowlist holds exactly 1 entry, pick-text-range).
- ~~**Bake the parse-check into the build-time `@hyperscript-tools/i18n` transpiler**
  (roadmap §5)~~ — **DONE for the English side**: `packages/hyperscript-tools-i18n/src/validate.ts`
  reuses the `loadCanonicalParser` recipe (self-contained: node builtins + `hyperscript.org`,
  extraction-ready) to gate the ENGLISH input (`from === 'en'`) and foreign→English output
  (`to === 'en'`). Surfaces: CLI `--check` (exit 3), Eleventy `parseCheck: 'off'|'warn'|'error'`
  (default warn), `@hyperscript-tools/i18n/validate` API. Faithful foreign-OUTPUT gating still
  awaits the v2 semantic-engine transpiler (the i18n GrammarTransformer is lossy in reverse).

## Probe recipe

Read translations from `patterns.db` (populate first) — never hand-write foreign source
(a hand-written `el valor` once suggested `the`→`el` needed translating; the real corpus
keeps `the` in English):

```ts
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
import { parseSemantic, render } from '@lokascript/semantic';
const db = new Database('packages/patterns-reference/data/patterns.db', { readonly: true });
const r = db.prepare(
  "SELECT hyperscript FROM pattern_translations WHERE code_example_id=? AND language=?"
).get('focus-trap', 'ru');
render(parseSemantic(r.hyperscript, 'ru').node, 'en'); // what the gate validates
```

The probe file MUST live inside a package dir (e.g. `packages/testing-framework/`) — a
scratchpad outside the workspace cannot resolve `node_modules`. Delete it after.

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL — run after EACH fix, before committing

- Rebuild: `npm run build --prefix packages/semantic`. **`dist/` staleness is silent** —
  a green run against a stale dist is vacuously green.
- `npm run test:affected` — a semantic change fans out to ~33 consumers incl.
  `hyperscript-adapter` (its own `preprocessToEnglish` + renderer). **`domain-toolkit`
  "fails" because it has 0 test files — pre-existing, ignore it.**
  **If `testing-framework` ALSO fails, it is almost certainly an ordering artifact, not
  your change:** `test:affected`'s `ensure-fresh` hook rebuilds a stale dep mid-run, which
  invalidates the `patterns.db` provenance stamp under the canonical gate. Run
  `npm run check:fresh && npm run populate --prefix packages/patterns-reference` FIRST,
  then re-run. (Bit Phase 4 once; a direct `npm test --prefix packages/testing-framework`
  passed while `test:affected` failed.)
- `npm run populate --prefix packages/patterns-reference` then
  `npm run test:canonical --prefix packages/testing-framework` (both gates; sets
  `FOREIGN_CANONICAL_VALIDITY=1`). The foreign gate reads authored translations from
  `patterns.db`, which the committed copy LAGS — you MUST populate first.
- Prune: `npx tsx packages/testing-framework/tools/regen-foreign-baseline.ts`.
  **Confirm ADDED is 0.** It REWRITES the baseline every run, so a 2nd run always shows
  0/0; `git checkout --` it first to re-read a diff. Cross-check `failing == before −
  CLEARED + ADDED`.
- Fidelity ratchet: `cd packages/testing-framework && npx tsx src/multilingual/cli.ts
  --full --bundle browser-priority --regression`. **Re-populate AFTER any semantic
  rebuild** or it refuses with a provenance-stamp error (working as designed). Mind the
  tolerance blind spot above.
- The **en-render gate must stay green** (en is the target).

## Footguns

- **Never commit `packages/patterns-reference/data/patterns.db`** — `git checkout --` it.
  **But `git checkout --` on it reverts to the STALE committed copy**, so the next gate run
  fails for a reason that is not your change. Re-`populate` before any further gate/probe
  work. (Bit Phase 4: a green gate went red purely from the cleanup step.)
- ~~**`regen-foreign-baseline.ts` reformats the JSON**~~ — fixed (validity-infra PR): the
  tool now writes through prettier itself, so a no-change regen produces a zero diff.
- **Exit-code masking is real.** `cmd > log; echo $?; grep …` reports the GREP's status.
  Read the explicit `EXIT=` line, not the harness's summary.
- The foreign gate throwing `Unknown token: <char>` IS the signal, not a harness bug.
- **zsh does not word-split** `$vars` — `for p in $pkgs` iterates once. Use literal lists.
- **The MCP server is NOT a valid probe channel mid-arc** — but it now TELLS you instead of
  lying. `.mcp.json` runs `mcp-server/dist/index.js`, which does not bundle semantic: it
  resolves the workspace symlink to `packages/semantic/dist/` **at startup** and node caches
  the module graph, so every rebuild leaves it serving pre-change code. Since the freshness
  guard (`packages/mcp-server/src/freshness.ts`) landed, a tool call after a rebuild returns
  an `isError` refusal naming the rebuilt packages and telling you to restart the server,
  rather than answering from stale code. **A refusal there is the guard working, not a
  bug** — restart the server (`/mcp` → reconnect). The `patterns.db` half self-heals: the
  connection reopens when `populate` replaces the file. Still prefer the `tsx` probe recipe
  above mid-arc; it imports fresh each run and needs no restart.
