# Handoff: foreign→English validity burndown (Phase 7 — post `as`/`beep!`)

Paste the block below into a fresh session to continue the arc. Everything above the
`---` is orientation for a human; the prompt itself starts after it.

**Arc state:** Phases 1a (#707), 1b + 3 (#711), **2 (the operator/copula slice, #718)**,
**4 (`no` + `references` drift + the condition locative, #719)**, **5 (the context
globals `document`/`window`/`detail`, #721)**, and **6 (the `as` connective zh/hi + the
`beep!` possessive glue+leak)** shipped. Foreign→English render validity
**90.7 % → 97.4 % (2979/3059)**. **80 pairs across 19 patterns** remain.

MISSION: Phase 7 of the foreign→English validity burndown. Authored non-English LokaScript
currently renders canonically-valid English **97.4 % (2979/3059)**; **80 pairs across 19
patterns** remain. Phases 2, 4, 5, and 6 are DONE. **The residual is fully triaged** — the table
in § "What is left" was produced by rendering all pairs and clustering them by the
canonical parser's actual complaint, so it is measured, not estimated.

**The two vocabulary/expression slices are now exhausted** (`as` and `beep!` shipped in
Phase 6). What remains has **no shared root cause** — it is per-row structural parse damage
plus a handful of deliberately-blocked ambiguous exclusions. The single plausibly-mechanical
item left is **`form-submit-prevent` ar registration ORDER** (`profile.references` registers
AFTER `keywords`, so an ar `is` entry is silently overwritten — `base-tokenizer.ts:502` vs
`:482`); it is one code change, not vocabulary. **Do not start with `pick-text-range` (23)** —
the spike verdict below explains why it is ~3 arcs, not one PR. The realistic Phase 7 framing
is: either take the `form-submit-prevent` registration-order fix, or accept 97.4 % as the
practical ceiling and pivot to the two preserved infra follow-ups (fold validity in as an R4
ratchet signal; bake the parse-check into the `@hyperscript-tools/i18n` transpiler).

**Phase 5 registered `document`/`window`/`detail` in one shared Set + 20 profiles — DO NOT
re-plan it.** It is drift reconciliation (core's `REFERENCE_KEYWORDS` and the parser's
`PROPERTY_ACCESS_BASES` already listed all three; only `DEFAULT_REFERENCES` and the semantic
`ReferenceValue` union lagged). Cleared 7 pairs and 51 gate-invisible silent corrections.
Named follow-ups it left, all preserved below: (a) three more desynced reference lists
(`semantic-parser.ts:4149` live; two `isBuiltInReference` copies test-only); (b) the
`window's scrollY` lossy-possessive round-trip; (c) `detail` bare-reference has no corpus
row yet.

**THE ARC'S GOVERNING LESSON, which this doc has itself violated four times: PROBE THE
CLAIM BEFORE YOU PLAN AROUND IT — AND PROBE THE FIX'S PREMISE.** Every phase found a
load-bearing falsehood in its own handoff — a "case-sensitive" lookup that lowercases, a
cautionary example that does not reproduce, three "dead on arrival" languages that all
worked, a defect count 5× too high, a 17-pair family that was 7, and a marquee "role
capture" fix-site that a single same-slot probe (`ボディ`→`body`) refutes. Each was one probe
away from being caught. **Including the claims in this paragraph.**

READ FIRST (in order):

1. § "What is left" below — the triage. It supersedes every earlier prose estimate.
2. `packages/testing-framework/baselines/foreign-canonical-validity.json` — the
   committed allowlist (87 pairs / 20 patterns after Phase 5). It ratchets BOTH ways: a
   pair you clear must be pruned, or the gate fails on a stale entry.
3. `docs-internal/EXPRESSION_INTERNAL_TRANSLATION_SCOPE.md` — the spec, § "Where the
   burndown stands".
4. `packages/semantic/src/parser/utils/expression-lexicon.ts` — the shared expression
   seam. Phase 4 closed its last call-site gap; **it is unlikely you need to touch it.**

## What Phase 2 established (do not re-derive)

- **The fix was profile DATA, not a new mechanism.** `surfaceOf`
  (`expression-lexicon.ts:371-372`) emits a token's `normalized` English form **iff it
  lexed as a keyword**; anything else leaks verbatim. So the whole copula/operator gap
  was *missing `profile.keywords` entries*. No slot parameter, no `COPULA_LEXICON`, no
  renderer change. Three PRs, zero logic changes (bar one dead-code removal), 70 pairs:
  `matches` ×13 profiles → 15 pairs, `exists` ×13 → 13, `is` ×10 → 42.
- **A slot parameter would not have worked anyway.** `es` is Spanish `is`
  (`spanish.ts`) but German `it` (`german.ts`). That is a *language* axis, not a slot
  axis; the profile is already the per-language axis.
- **`is`/`exists`/`matches`/`no` are phantom-SAFE**, unlike `empty`. `empty` is both an
  ActionType (`types.ts`) and a command schema (`command-schemas.ts`) — that is why ja
  `空` injected a phantom command (`japanese.ts:108-111`). The operators are neither, so
  no pattern is generated from them. Verify for any new word; don't assume.
- **`CONDITION_COPULAS_SURFACE` (`semantic-parser.ts`) is down to 3 entries** (ar هو /
  th เป็น / hi है) — exactly the three the copula slice could not register, because each
  is ambiguous with another sense. It is no longer a general mechanism.
- **Deliberate exclusions, each ambiguous with another sense** (all cost real pairs; all
  are the honest call): ar هو=`it`, hi है=`has/have`, th เป็น=`as` (copula); bn আছে=`has`,
  tl `may`/tr `var`=`has/have` (exists). ar is *structurally* impossible regardless:
  `profile.references` is registered AFTER `keywords` (`base-tokenizer.ts`), so an ar
  `is` entry is silently overwritten.
- ja `である` does **NOT** split, contrary to an earlier claim. It is registered and clears.
- **The ratchet's tolerances can hide a small regression.** `avgFidelity` tolerance 0.02
  averaged over ~133 patterns cannot see one pattern dropping to fid 0.75 (0.25/133 ≈
  0.002), and the lossy-flip counter has tolerance 3. When a change has a *named*
  single-pattern hazard, probe that pattern directly. (Phase 2 did: the copula slice
  removed ja/bn's escape from the ko-class "guard swallows the then-branch verb" bug.)

## What Phase 4 shipped (three PRs, 30 pairs, 124 → 94)

All three are DONE. Recorded here because each corrected something this doc asserted —
**the doc's own claims were the least reliable input to the arc.** Every correction below
was verified against the AUTHORED corpus rows, not reasoned from the code.

**1. `no` — `behavior-draggable` 20 → 9 (11 pairs).** Pure profile data, Phase 2's shape.
Registered in 16 languages.

- **The "dead on arrival" call was wrong for all three.** id `tidak_ada` and qu
  `mana_kanchu` clear via a whole-token tokenizer EXTRAS entry (the `ubah_ukuran` /
  `hatun_kay` precedent — the keyword walk sorts longest-first, so the compound beats the
  `_` split); ar `لا يوجد` clears via the base tokenizer's multi-word keyword walk (the hi
  `मेل खाता` precedent). **id and qu cleared the gate outright.** The lesson: "the
  tokenizer splits it" is not a reason to give up — check for a whole-token precedent.
- **The ja `ない` hazard is real in principle but does not fire.** `ない` has blast radius 3
  and the dict's `not` (`ではない`) is unregistered, so the particle extractor peels で/は and
  can land on a bare `ない`. Probed: `unless-condition` (protected by `ない限り`, longest-first)
  and `fetch-do-not-throw` both render byte-identically before and after.
- **bn is not lexical.** Its dict has no `no`, so its row already carries literal English
  `no` and renders it correctly; it fails structurally. The ceiling was 19, not 20.
- The hi/zh/tl exclusions stand, but the reason is **dict-level**, not a profile
  collision: those profiles never register the surface — the DICT maps two senses to one
  (`hi not:'नहीं'` AND `no:'नहीं'`), so registering it as `no` would mistranslate every
  `not`/`without` in those corpora. es `not:'no'` was a non-issue as written.

**2. `references` drift — `modal-close-backdrop` 2 → 0, `focus-trap` ja (3 pairs).** Three
tokenizer EXTRAS lines + `matches` for ar/ja. **Both reasons this doc gave for deferring it
as a CODE change are FALSE:**

- **The lookup is NOT case-sensitive.** `lookupKeyword`/`isKeyword` both `.toLowerCase()`
  (`packages/framework/src/core/tokenization/base-tokenizer.ts` — note this doc pointed at
  a path that does not exist; `packages/semantic/src/parser/base-tokenizer.ts` is a
  re-export). The cited `:633-634` is a COMMENT inside `tryMultiWordKeyword`, which only
  handles space-containing keywords and which German never reaches. **The whole de
  sub-family was a non-issue** — de renders `body`/`target` correctly today.
- **No type change was needed.** The per-language `*_EXTRAS` array already supports
  alternates and overrides profile entries (precedent: `japanese.ts` `私`→me).
- **The stated cautionary example does not exist.** de/fr/pt `if-exists` do NOT "clear
  while still leaking `körper`/`ça`/`isso`" — probed against the authored rows, all three
  render byte-identically to en (`körper` via the case-insensitive lookup, `ça`/`isso` via
  existing EXTRAS).
- Of the 16 "drifted" entries only **3 actually leak** (ar `نتيجة`/`هدف`, ja `対象`); the
  rest are absorbed by the case-insensitive lookup, EXTRAS, `possessive.keywords`, or a
  profile keyword. 16 was right as a text-diff and ~5× too high as a defect count.

**The operand+operator coupling was REAL, and is the arc's one durable lesson.** The
condition is captured as a raw string; ar/ja's *unparsed* condition was silently dropped,
so `hide` ran unconditionally and coincidentally matched the en DOM effect —
`modal-close-backdrop` ar/ja passed R2 **by accident**. `matches` alone would parse the
condition into a real comparison whose operand evaluates to undefined, stopping `hide` and
flipping R2 pass→fail at tolerance 0. Both together render byte-identical to en. Only R2
can see this class.

**3. Condition locative — `focus-trap` 19 → 3 (16 pairs, incl. a `last-in-collection tr`
bonus).** The diagnosis in this doc was RIGHT; two details were not.

- **`surfaceOf` has THREE failure modes, not two:** verbatim leak, role-name leak, and
  wrong-sense-normalized leak (bn `শেষ`→`end`, out of scope — a dict realign).
- **The prescription omitted anchor ORDER, which is load-bearing.** The new anchor must sit
  AFTER the of-possessive anchor so it can only claim runs the earlier anchors declined
  (provably additive). Positional-first would flip `<positional> <sel> <of-marker> <sel>`
  away from `<sel> of <sel>`, and for a marker absent from `LOCATIVE_SURFACES` (zh `的`,
  ja `の`) `toEnglishLocative` falls through to the VERBATIM surface — worse than the leak.
- No data was added: `toEnglishLocative` / `LOCATIVE_SURFACES` /
  `ROLE_CONCEPT_TO_ENGLISH_LOCATIVE` already covered both classes. It was purely a
  call-site gap. `matchPositionalRun` now serves both seams.
- The run returns `{text, token}` pairs, not strings: the two callers join differently
  (role seam = plain space; the raw join needs SOURCE POSITION for `.`-glue). Bare strings
  would silently render `previous <input/> .value` inside conditions.

## What is left (80 pairs) — MEASURED, not estimated

Produced by rendering all allowlisted pairs and clustering by the canonical parser's actual
complaint. **Reproduce it before trusting it** (recipe at the end of this section). Phase 5
removed the `document` row (7 pairs); `window` proved structural, not data. Phase 6 removed
the `beep!` row (5 pairs) and the zh/hi half of the `as` row (2 pairs) — leaving only th's
copula collision on `computed-value`.

| # | Family | Kind | Where |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 23 | `pick-text-range` | deferred, ~3 arcs | all but en |
| 23 | structural (no leak) | per-row | see list below |

| 7 | singles | various | hi `नहीं`, ko `정`, bn `এর`/`আছে`, ar `من`, zh `执行`, hi `बदलने` |

### 1. DONE (Phase 5) — `document`/`window`/`detail` context globals — 7 pairs, pure data

**Shipped. Left here so no future session re-spikes the wrong fix.** Cleared 7 validity pairs
(`behavior-draggable` ar/ja/ko/ru/uk, `behavior-sortable` ja/zh) plus **51 gate-invisible
silent corrections** (es `from documento` → `from document`, etc.). Validity 96.9 % → 97.2 %.

**The fix, in full:** widen `DEFAULT_REFERENCES` (`packages/intent/src/ir/references.ts`) with
`document`/`window`/`detail`; extend the `ReferenceValue` union (`packages/semantic/src/types.ts`);
add the three surfaces to `references` in the 20 profiles whose dict carries them (skip
bn/he/th/vi — no dict entry; they author literal English `document` and already round-trip).
Update the count assertion in `packages/framework/src/ir/references.test.ts` (7 → 10). Guard:
`packages/semantic/test/context-globals-references.test.ts`. **Zero logic change.**

**Named follow-ups (do NOT fold into a `beep!`/`as` PR):** three more desynced reference
lists — `semantic-parser.ts:4149` (LIVE if-chain), and two `isBuiltInReference` copies
(`packages/semantic/src/parser/utils/type-validation.ts:142`,
`packages/framework/src/core/pattern-matching/utils/type-validation.ts:132`, test-only) —
none on the fix's path, but they should route through `isValidReference` so the next widening
can't desync; the five parallel `protocol/` lists (ts/py/rust + ABNF, out of the workspace,
nothing breaks but the sense now differs); and the `window's scrollY` lossy-possessive
round-trip (`set x to body's scrollTop` → `set x to body` — pre-existing for `body`, now
extended to window/document; no corpus row exercises it, `window-scroll` keeps it in an `if`
condition, verified VALID). `detail` has no bare-reference corpus row — its registration is
preventive drift-reconciliation only.

### 2. DONE (Phase 6) — The `as` connective — zh + hi cleared (2 pairs); th deferred

**Shipped.** zh `作为` (rendered `作 for Number`) and hi `के_रूप_में` (rendered
`के _ रूप _ में`) now render `as Number`. The reverse `CONNECTIVE_LEXICON` entries already
existed; the tokenizer shattered the compound before lookup.

- **zh** — whole-token `CHINESE_EXTRAS` entry `{作为→as}`; longest-first beats the 1-char
  `为`→`for`. Pure data, as expected.
- **hi** — the EXTRAS entry `{के_रूप_में→as}` was **necessary but NOT sufficient** (the
  "`ubah_ukuran`/`mana_kanchu` precedent is the fix" claim was wrong). `के` is a possessive
  PARTICLE, so `HindiParticleExtractor` (registered ahead of `HindiKeywordExtractor`) peeled
  it off before the underscore-recovery ran. `आकार_बदलें` works only because `आकार` is not a
  particle. Second fix: `HindiParticleExtractor.underscoreJoinedKeyword` declines when the
  run is an underscore-joined REGISTERED keyword, ceding it to the keyword extractor.
- **th `เป็น` — still deferred.** BOTH `as` and copula `is`; a blanket entry rewrites every
  Thai `is`. `computed-value` th remains allowlisted (1 pair). Would need slot-sensitive
  disambiguation (resolve to `as` only before a type name) — NOT attempted.
- **`computed-value` id is unrelated** — it renders `as Number` fine; it fails on the
  possessive tail `my punya nilai` (structural, § 5), so it stays allowlisted.

### 3. DONE (Phase 6) — `beep!` possessive glue+leak — all 5 cleared

**Shipped.** `beep-debug-expression` bn/hi/ja/ko/tr now render the canonical `beep! my value`.
The handoff's premise was doubly wrong:

- **`joinExpressionTokens`'s possessive anchor is INNOCENT and was never called** for this
  value. The `beep!`-headed run fails every generated `set` pattern, so the clause takes the
  SOV verb-anchoring fallback, whose `tokensToSemanticValue` empty-string-glued the tokens
  (`beep!私の値`) AND skipped translation. Fix = route only the multi-token fall-through
  through `joinExpressionTokens` (`semantic-parser.ts`); the possessive anchor then fires.
- **A second defect the handoff missed:** `beep!` tokenizes as `beep` + `!`, and the
  canonical parser REJECTS the spaced `beep !` ("Unexpected Token : !"). So the join had to
  GAIN a rule — a source-adjacent leading `!` glues like the `.`-member rule
  (`expression-lexicon.ts`). "The join loses its spaces" was only half the story; it also had
  to STOP adding one.
- **en is separately, pre-existingly broken and DEFERRED.** `set $x to beep! my value` →
  `set $x to beep` (the `matchRoleToken` single-token slot capture drops `! my value`;
  `beep` alone is a valid canonical identifier, so en is not in the en-render allowlist).
  Fixing it means folding `beep! <expr>` as an expression prefix in
  `pattern-matcher.ts` value-slot capture — a different root cause on the primary parse path
  for all languages. Named follow-up; clears **0** foreign gate pairs (the foreign gate never
  renders en→en).

### 4. Deliberately blocked (12) — do NOT "fix" without reading why

- hi `है` (5) and th `เป็น` (5) are the copula slice's **named ambiguous exclusions**
  (`है`=has/have, `เป็น`=as). Registering either mistranslates every `has`/`as` in those
  corpora. Only a slot-aware disambiguation helps, and Phase 2 established the slot axis
  is the WRONG axis (`es` is Spanish `is` but German `it`). Treat as genuinely hard.
- ja `空` (2) is the **phantom-injection word** (`japanese.ts:108-111`): `empty` is both an
  ActionType and a command schema, so registering `空` injects a phantom command. This is
  the one place the "register the surface" reflex is actively wrong.

### 5. Structural, no leak (23) — per-row, no shared root cause

`behavior-removable` ar/id/qu · `behavior-sortable` qu · `computed-value` id ·
`fetch-error-handling` qu · `focus-trap` tl · `form-submit-prevent` ar · `if-empty` ar/id ·
`if-exists` tl/tr · `input-validation` ar/id · `modal-close-escape` pl · `swap-content`
ar/bn/hi/qu/tl/tr · `two-way-binding` id · `window-keydown` tl

Known shapes: `focus-trap` ar/tl (stray `من .modal`/`source .modal`, displaced
`[key=="Tab"]`) · `swap-content` ar `بـ#b` fusion · id `saya punya nilai` → `my punya nilai`
(the possessive head translated, the rest left) · `form-submit-prevent` ar, blocked by the
**registration ORDER** (`profile.references` registers AFTER `keywords`,
`base-tokenizer.ts:502` vs `:482`, so an ar `is` entry is silently overwritten — a code
change, plausibly the last mechanical win).

### Reproduce the triage

The gate hides exactly what you need: `checkForeignRenderValidity` assigns
`rendered = '(threw)'` in its catch, so when `validate()` throws — ~46 of the residual —
**the render that caused it is discarded**. Render and validate SEPARATELY:

```ts
// packages/testing-framework/triage.ts — delete after
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
import { parseSemantic, render } from '@lokascript/semantic';
import { loadCanonicalParser } from './src/multilingual/canonical-validity';
const validate = await loadCanonicalParser();
const db = new Database('../../packages/patterns-reference/data/patterns.db', { readonly: true });
const src = (db.prepare(
  'SELECT hyperscript FROM pattern_translations WHERE code_example_id=? AND language=?'
).get('behavior-draggable', 'ja') as any).hyperscript;
const rendered = render(parseSemantic(src, 'ja').node!, 'en');
console.log(rendered);                       // ← keep this OUT of the try that validates
try { console.log(validate(rendered)); } catch (e) { console.log('LEAK:', e.message); }
```

Grep the render for non-ASCII to find the leak — in a 20-line behavior body the bad token
is one word on one line, and the parser only reports a single CHARACTER.

## SPIKE VERDICT: `pick-text-range` — keep deferred, and the docs' reason was wrong

The old framing ("a named R1 deferral: pick range-role modeling", "one en-side fix
clears 23 foreign + 1 en") is **wrong on both counts**. It is not one fix, and it is not
range-roles. It is four coupled efforts:

1. **The schema models the wrong command.** `pickSchema` (`command-schemas.ts:2598`) is
   *"Select a random element from a collection"* with roles patient/source
   (`pick <item1>, <item2>` / `pick from <array>`). Canonical hyperscript's `pick`
   (`hyperscript.org@0.9.93`, `dist/_hyperscript.js:5979-6090`) is a different command
   with **6 variants** (`first`/`last`/`random`/`item(s)`/`character(s)`/`match(es)`),
   each with its own arg shape, plus a range sub-grammar
   `[at|from] (start|<expr>) [to (end|<expr>)] [inclusive|exclusive]`.
2. **The vocabulary does not exist in ANY language.** No dict defines `characters`,
   `items`, `random`, `start`, `end`, `inclusive`, or `exclusive`. The corpus proves it:
   all 23 translations leave `characters` in **literal English**.
3. **The corpus rows are themselves broken.** The range `to` was translated as a
   DESTINATION marker (es `0 a 5`, it `0 in 5`, vi `0 vào 5`, th `0 ใน 5`, ru `0 в 5`),
   and the SOV rows are scrambled (ja `characters 0 を クリック で 選択 5 の #note に`,
   qu, tr, bn, hi, ko). Re-authoring them couples to the fidelity baseline
   (memory: `corpus-rewrites-couple-to-fidelity`).
4. **R1 would move** — the roles change shape.

So the en fix alone clears **1** pair (the en allowlist entry), not 24; the 23 foreign
pairs additionally need (2) and (3). Budget it as ~3 arcs, not one PR. It remains the
sole entry in `baselines/canonical-validity.json`.

## Also true (verified, corrects the record)

- The residual is **20 patterns / 87 pairs** after Phase 5 (`document` cleared 7 across
  `behavior-draggable`/`behavior-sortable`, but neither pattern left the allowlist — both
  keep other-language failures). It was 20 patterns / 94 pairs after Phase 4, 21 before, and
  never the 19 the pre-Phase-2 handoff and the scope doc both claimed.
- The sibling **en-render burndown is DONE** — `canonical-validity.json` holds exactly
  **1** entry (`pick-text-range`), not the 22 that `HANDOFF_render-validity-burndown.md`
  described. That doc is deleted; its two still-live follow-ups are preserved below.
- `repeat-until-event` fr/it/zh/pl is **NOT** a real family — it was stale-dist/stale-DB
  noise. A freshly populated DB reproduces the committed baseline exactly.
- `marker-templates.ts` is dead code (zero importers) despite `semantic/CLAUDE.md`.
- **This doc has been the arc's least reliable input.** Phase 4 found a false premise in
  every family it touched (a "case-sensitive" lookup that lowercases; a cautionary example
  that does not reproduce; three "dead on arrival" languages that all work; a defect count
  ~5× too high). All were cheap to disprove with one probe against the authored corpus.
  **Probe the claim before you plan around it** — including the claims above.

## Preserved follow-ups (from the now-deleted render-validity handoff)

- **Fold validity in as an R4 signal** on the ratchet CLI (`--regression`), so validity
  is first-class alongside R0–R3.
- **Bake the parse-check into the build-time `@hyperscript-tools/i18n` transpiler**
  (roadmap §5).

## Probe recipe

Read translations from `patterns.db` (populate first) — never hand-write foreign source
(a hand-written `el valor` once suggested `the`→`el` needed translating; the real corpus
keeps `the` in English):

```ts
import Database from 'better-sqlite3';
import { parseSemantic, render } from '@lokascript/semantic';
const db = new Database('packages/patterns-reference/data/patterns.db', { readonly: true });
const r = db.prepare(
  "SELECT hyperscript FROM pattern_translations WHERE code_example_id=? AND language=?"
).get('focus-trap', 'ru');
render(parseSemantic(r.hyperscript, 'ru').node, 'en'); // what the gate validates
```

The probe file MUST live inside a package dir (e.g. `packages/testing-framework/`) — a
scratchpad outside the workspace cannot resolve `node_modules`. Delete it after.

## VERIFICATION PROTOCOL — run after EACH fix, before committing

- Rebuild: `npm run build --prefix packages/semantic`. **`dist/` staleness is silent** —
  a green run against a stale dist is vacuously green.
- `npm run test:affected` — a semantic change fans out to ~33 consumers incl.
  `hyperscript-adapter` (its own `preprocessToEnglish` + renderer). **`domain-toolkit`
  "fails" because it has 0 test files — pre-existing, ignore it.**
  **If `testing-framework` ALSO fails, it is almost certainly an ordering artifact, not
  your change:** `test:affected`'s `ensure-fresh` hook rebuilds a stale dep mid-run, which
  invalidates the `patterns.db` provenance stamp under the canonical gate. Run
  `npm run check:fresh && npm run populate --prefix packages/patterns-reference` FIRST,
  then re-run. (Bit Phase 4 once; a direct `npm test --prefix packages/testing-framework`
  passed while `test:affected` failed.)
- `npm run populate --prefix packages/patterns-reference` then
  `npm run test:canonical --prefix packages/testing-framework` (both gates; sets
  `FOREIGN_CANONICAL_VALIDITY=1`). The foreign gate reads authored translations from
  `patterns.db`, which the committed copy LAGS — you MUST populate first.
- Prune: `npx tsx packages/testing-framework/tools/regen-foreign-baseline.ts`.
  **Confirm ADDED is 0.** It REWRITES the baseline every run, so a 2nd run always shows
  0/0; `git checkout --` it first to re-read a diff. Cross-check `failing == before −
  CLEARED + ADDED`.
- Fidelity ratchet: `cd packages/testing-framework && npx tsx src/multilingual/cli.ts
  --full --bundle browser-priority --regression`. **Re-populate AFTER any semantic
  rebuild** or it refuses with a provenance-stamp error (working as designed). Mind the
  tolerance blind spot above.
- The **en-render gate must stay green** (en is the target).

## Footguns

- **Never commit `packages/patterns-reference/data/patterns.db`** — `git checkout --` it.
  **But `git checkout --` on it reverts to the STALE committed copy**, so the next gate run
  fails for a reason that is not your change. Re-`populate` before any further gate/probe
  work. (Bit Phase 4: a green gate went red purely from the cleanup step.)
- **`regen-foreign-baseline.ts` reformats the JSON** (explodes single-line arrays), which
  buries your real diff in churn. Run `npx prettier --write` on the baseline afterwards.
- **Exit-code masking is real.** `cmd > log; echo $?; grep …` reports the GREP's status.
  Read the explicit `EXIT=` line, not the harness's summary.
- The foreign gate throwing `Unknown token: <char>` IS the signal, not a harness bug.
- **zsh does not word-split** `$vars` — `for p in $pkgs` iterates once. Use literal lists.
- **The MCP server is NOT a valid probe channel mid-arc** — but it now TELLS you instead of
  lying. `.mcp.json` runs `mcp-server/dist/index.js`, which does not bundle semantic: it
  resolves the workspace symlink to `packages/semantic/dist/` **at startup** and node caches
  the module graph, so every rebuild leaves it serving pre-change code. Since the freshness
  guard (`packages/mcp-server/src/freshness.ts`) landed, a tool call after a rebuild returns
  an `isError` refusal naming the rebuilt packages and telling you to restart the server,
  rather than answering from stale code. **A refusal there is the guard working, not a
  bug** — restart the server (`/mcp` → reconnect). The `patterns.db` half self-heals: the
  connection reopens when `populate` replaces the file. Still prefer the `tsx` probe recipe
  above mid-arc; it imports fresh each run and needs no restart.
